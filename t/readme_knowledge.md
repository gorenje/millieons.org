## Readme Knowledge

The kind of knowledge that you don't want keep in your head, rather write down in a readme for later reference.

Or when installing software, especially on a cloud service, all the stuff you have to do is readme knowledge. Setting up roles, permissions, networks, secrets, etc. Each service have different ways of doing this. The best practices for doing all this change constantly. So even if you setup a service six months ago, it might well be that it is done differently now.

And that is all readme knowledge, knowledge that is constantly changing. It's applied rarely and when you apply again, it has probably changed.
