## Unix Philosophy

The [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) is something that makes Unix and Linux so specularly good!

Amongst other things it says that a program should just do one thing and do that well. This has lead to thousands of programs that available on a Unix system but that when chained together, to do something useful!

The chaining of commands is based on another Unix Philosophy and that is that all commands shall use text as input and produce text as output. So the chaining only connects the output of one command to the input of the next command.

Wonderful stuff.

You then end up with thousand different commands in your head and unlike [readme knowledge](/t/readme-knowledge), nothing changes. Some Unix commands are 30+ years old and still do exactly the same as they ever have, in the same way. Unix commands remain [backward compatible](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/backward%20compatible) and are either extended or replaced but existing functionality is never removed.

### Why am I saying all this?

Because that is something I do in my writing. I try to present just one concept and discuss only this one concept. Then I try, and often fail, to chain these together to make something readable.
