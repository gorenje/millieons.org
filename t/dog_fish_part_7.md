## Fables from the Hood - Dog and Fish / Separation

...intro here...

Fish: Dog, you have fairly good conversational skills. In fact, very good I must say.

Dog: Why thank you Fish! How is it that you come to say that?

Fish: Well I just a couple of days ago I was having a conversation with the Crab. You know, Crab who is so frustrated because he doesn't get to do what he really wanted to do....

Dog: Oh yes, you mean Crab who wanted to become and artist but ended up drawing pictures for the film industry?

Fish: Yes that's one. Well, the Crab is constantly telling me about some stuff that he watched on YouTube, you know the stuff I really don't care about.

Dog: I think I know where you heading with this. We have had this conversation so many times. Look, you know Crab is Crab, and Crab will never change!

Fish: No this time it's enough. Not only have I been telling him to stop interrupting me when I'm in the middle of saying something ....

Dog: You mean like this?

Fish: ... Indeed. Anyway what was I saying ...

Dog: There in lies the problem. You loss your thread when people do that. It is so annoying.

Fish: Thankfully there are people who have enough patiences to wait until one is finished speaking ones mind. 

Fish (cont): Anyway I've been telling him for years not to interrupt. Yes, so once get he interrupted me and once again he apologised. 

Dog: So that's ok then, I mean if he was said sorry.

Fish: Well no. He's said sorry each and every time and continues doing it. I cannot accept his apologies so many times. After all, an apology is an acceptance of fault.

Dog: Fault that can be forgiven but that should ideally not occur. Meaning no one has to apologise and no one has to accept that apology.

Fish: And more importantly no one gets emotional hurt nor frustrated by continuously being interrupted in the middle of ones sentence.

Dog: But what was it that finally cooked the goose?

Fish: Well I was sitting there having a conversation with the Toad. You know the Toad is wise animal and we were philosophising about life and death. I was in the middle of a rather personal story when the Crab showed up.

Dog: I can smell the frying bacon ....

Fish: So the Crab just sits down at our table. Not bothering asking whether he could join or even following the conversation. I got another sentence out and then the Crab simply buds in and begins with one of his YouTube topics.

Dog: Well that's the Crab, you know that he will always do that.

Fish: I know. And the Toad also switched to talking about YouTube, no respect for what I was talking about. Perhaps it wasn't interesting for them, but neither was their topic for me.

Fish (cont): So I go and sit opposite the table and talk to the Oyster.

Dog: She is always a good conversation. She knows how to have a proper conversation.

Fish: Indeed! So we where having our conversation when the Crab interrupted that too! Turning around after about ten minutes, the Crab interrupted and apologised for interrupting previously and that I can now continue my story.

Dog: So the Crab actually remembered you were in the middle of your story?

Fish: Yes. And with his kind permission, I could now continue that story with the Toad.

Dog: Wow. Ok, so the frustrated old Crab could one-up you by interrupting your conversation with the Toad, then ignoring you, then having his speech - and it's always a speech - with the Toad. After he was finished, he turned around to you and apologised, reminded you that you were in the middle of saying something.

Fish: Yes, exactly that. I explained to the Crab that I found it extremely rude what he had done and that, no I wasn't going to continue. Which did surprise the old Crab.

Dog: Have you tried sorting it out with the Crab?

Fish: Well strangely on the that day I found an [article](https://aeon.co/essays/the-psychologist-carl-rogers-and-the-art-of-active-listening) describing how someone who would constantly interrupt got over that since they understood it to be rude.

Dog: Did the Crab saying anything about that?

Fish: Well he said he was going to write a response, but apparently there was no more power on his phone.

Dog: Can happen.

Fish: True, but on the other he did tell me whose fault it actually was.

Dog: And?

Fish: Well Crab told me that he wasn't actually to blame rather it was the Toad, it was the Toad that picked up on what he, the Crab, said. So in fact, Toad should have told Crab to be polite.

Dog: Wow. Now that's an ego! What are you now going to do?

Fish: Well I thought I'd give him a taste of his own medicine.

Dog: What you are going to interrupt all the time and ignore what other people say?

Fish: No, I don't want to join the Crab in the basement of human politeness. No, no, no. I'm simply going to ignore him just like he ignored me.

Dog: Do you think he will understand that?

Fish: Probably not, he's too frustrated and jealous to consider other peoples feelings.

Dog: But at least that way you're going the confrontation out of the way.

Fish: Sometimes separation is better than confrontation.
