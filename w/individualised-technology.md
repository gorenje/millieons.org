## Individualised Technology

*Meaning*: Technology designed to individualise societal interactions but also technology that is designed for individuals.

Take this thought and reflect a moment about the technology that your own. How much of it is designed to help you function within a society and how much of it is designed for you to survive as an individual in a societal context?

Reformulating the question: how much technology do you own that is designed to help you to interact with society in a positive sense? For example, technology that makes sharing with others easier, technology that makes caring for others easier, technology that makes it easier for a family unit to stay together.

Interestingly it is not technology, it is in fact capitalism that reduces societies to individuals - individuals buy more, societies share more.

Technology is just another symptom of the disease.

But before we replace capitalism with just another *ism*, how about we look into [possible reforms](/w/collateral-ballast) to the existing system.
