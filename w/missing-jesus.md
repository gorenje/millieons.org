## The missing Jesus Problem

*Before I begin: "Jesus" is just a placeholder, think of Messiah or Trump or Hilter or Gandhi or Johnson or Buddha or Godot - we don't know who is missing and therefore we are not sure who is coming, but it seems we are all waiting for someone.*

After a dystopian week of watching Adam Curtis' [TraumaZone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_1985â€“1999:_TraumaZone), listening to an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=663vLIYBcpI) of him, discovering Ayn Rands [Objectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism) philosophy and then also having read [*We*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_(novel)), my personal dystopian week was in need of course of medicine.

It was something that Adam Curtis had said in that interview that made me think. He made the point that people are waiting for an alternative but not only are they waiting, so also are those in charge, in fact everyone is waiting for an alternative but since we have tried out everything and no one has the imagine for coming up with something completely new and more importantly no one is willing to risk doing something completely new, nothing changes.

Hence the title of this article *The missing Jesus problem* - someone to come and solve all our problems for us. Take the responsibility for failure from us and just get on with it.

Instead we are stuck between we have tried everything and no one has  *the* idea for something new. Alternatively perhaps in fact we are living in society where we have *too many* alternatives however no one is willing to risk it and pick one or the other, just to give it a try.

So we are frozen in this world where we expect someone else to make a decision for us so that they carry the consequences for when it goes wrong, instead of us making that decision and *taking the consequence* on us. This is also something Adam Curtis touched on: we need to take responsibility for our own actions:

- It was we who created the slave trade, not the Russians.
- It was we who forced opium onto the Chinese, not the Russians.
- It was we who voted for Trump, not the Russians. 
- It was we who voted for Brexit, not the Russians. 
- It was we who created the climate change, not *only* the Russians.

Notice in all five 'we(st)' are the source of the problem. It might be fun to have a fun time in a plastic world and blame others for our mistakes, eventually though, those *others* will blame us for our mistakes.

This idea is not even dystopian, it is how the world works. You hit your neighbour, they hit you back. You burn down your neighbours house, they burn down yours, and so on. What we forget is that our neighbours do not necessarily take revenge straightaway, no it might take years or even centuries for them to take revenge. Hence the saying: revenge is a dish best savoured cold.

So it would be good if we realised that our actions *do have* consequences and *we are* the ones to face those consequences, not our parents, not our children but we. 

Remember, Geopolitical "revenge" is something played out over centuries. The Chinese have a [*term*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_humiliation) for the century of humiliation by the Western and they teach it to their children, its doubtful they will simply "forget" about that century. The Moslems still do not like to talk about the crusades (yes, they are 800 years ago!) and do not ask Africans (nor South Americans) about colonisation or the slave trade.

The Wests perspective is: *Oh, that .. oh, but that's soooo long ago, it's all good again. Hey, look we did give everyone their freedom back didn't we?!? And you know they trade with us now!*

And so this is where Jesus comes in. Jesus will come down lead us out of here, showing us a new path of peace and harmony amongst all humans. As thanks we will nail Jesus on on a cross again, continue on as before but claim: we have *now* seen the light and will live in peace and harmony with all humans, religions and races. 

Remember this is Jesus as a placeholder. Also do not forget, what we as a society are currently experiencing *is not in any way* new. No, it is not new. It happens fairly regularly and it keeps repeating, at the latest every hundred years or so. The only difference is that this time we have more advertising and marketing, so this one will be the biggest and best ever reality show: *The Complete Societal Destruction* brought to you by the loving support of large corporations A, B and C, and filmed in technicolor and streamed live on the internet. That last bit is is the new bit, the rest has been repeated throughout human history, since the cave~~men~~people.

[Roaring 20's followed by Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties), [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution), [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution), [Chinese Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Revolution), [Ethiopian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Revolution). (Ed: revolutionary order intended to spell "race to the bottom" but the author ran out of [revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revolutions_and_rebellions).) All revolutions have a common thread: a sudden power vacuum, the disenfranchised poor, the aimless rich - suddenly powerless and fearful (of losing their riches), a sudden emergence of a strong leader promising to empower the powerless and dethrone the powerful. I forgot to add the coming of Jesus to that list but one gets the picture.

We are currently at a point where no one thought they would ever be, since we have been telling ourselves that we have learned our lessons from history and it shan't ever happen again. And here we are, enjoy the view of the elephant in the room. Watch the elephant breaking all that nice china tableware we once purchased so that we could look at it (and no one else).

But I digress. I was not going to be so blunt in pointing out that history repeats itself, even in our time. What I actually wished to point out is that the interpretation of "missing" in "The missing Jesus problem" is not as obvious as one might think. I came up with four alternative interpretations and I assume there are many more, let me begin:

- "missing" in the sense of past tense: I miss Jesus and wish he would make a reappearance and save us all, just like the last time he was here. As a society we simply keep on waiting until Jesus comes down again - *the* Jesus in this case, *the* Jesus from the Bible, not the placeholder Jesus.

- "missing" in the sense of a jigsaw puzzle: we are looking for that last piece, it must be around here somewhere, damn where has it gotten to? Which would imply that our missing Jesus is amongst us somewhere and we as a society just need to find them.

- "missing" in the sense the society is broken and is missing a part. So if we had that Jesus figure, we could fix society and be done with it. So all we do is claim that Jesus has fixed society and society would work again. QED. Having not really changed anything at all.

- "missing" in the sense of waiting for [Godot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot). It's now past lunch time and Jesus had promised to come, where is Jesus? Should we start without him? No, surely not, Jesus did promise to come, so we'll wait just a little longer.

So which is it? Which *missing* is Societys' *missing*? Or perhaps we aren't *missing* anyone and just carry on as usual.

On the other hand, what if Jesus is in fact "technology"? So what if Jesus (the placeholder) wasn't human at all? What if Jesus turns out to be some super duper Artificial Intelligence only interested in playing chess with their other AI friends? Or what if Jesus (again the placeholder) were to be some pandemic or natural disaster or human made disaster or even a vengeful God?

The point regardless of how humorous I have tried to be, is that one should take the time to consider *important* issues. And dare to consider taboo alternatives to problems that seem insurmountable. If we only ever take the well worn path, we will always end up there were everyone else already is.

To end a bastardisation of Adam Curtis' philosophy of [Oh Dearism](https://thoughtmaybe.com/oh-dearism/): not all solutions to insurmountable problems must end in "Oh Dear".
