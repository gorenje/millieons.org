## Unconscious

Something that does the thinking for you. Sometimes it is best to stop thinking about a problem, think about something else and wait. Eventually you will come back to your original problem and you will have a solution. That's how the unconscious works.

Sit back and wait.

Worrying is the killer of getting things done. Don't worry and think and do something else. The solution will come to you. And you will find a way out if you give your subconscious time and space to do its magic.
