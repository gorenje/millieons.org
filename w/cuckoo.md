# Church of Unconscious and Conscious Knowledge of Octagons - Cuckoo

*Cuckoo* is a spiritual start-up providing an alternative to the repetitive prize wheel consumerism which is increasingly entrapping humankind.

It differs from pyramid schemes in two important ways, first the Cuckoo believes in octagons, not pyramids and secondly its a start-up and not a get-rich-quick scheme.

Octagons provide an abbreviational basis for Cuckoo. In Christian belief, octagons represent the day after the seven days God took to make the universe, the galaxies, the earth and us. Therefore octagons sometimes represents the Christian afterlife.

In Islam the octagon is the interface between heaven and earth, heaven being represented by the circle and the square representing the earthly world. The octagon sits neatly between these two locations.

For the Church of Uckoo, an octagon is a shape with eight sides. It was the first word that occurred to the founders of Cuckoo that began with 'o' and which made for a nice abbreviation. That's all.

The Church of Uckoo holds and maintains five core teachings, these are unconscious, dissonance, reinvention, independency and meaninglessness. Together these form the *Rationality of UDRIM*. Many beliefs stem from these core teachings and these beliefs are discussed in the Commentaries on Cuckoo, otherwise known as *The Book of CoC*.

## Teaching: Unconscious

At its heart, the Church of Uckoo postulates that the unconscious is the ultimate fulfiller of our dreams and ambitions. Cuckoo teaches that the unconscious exclusively underlies all other spirituality. To become more spiritual you must allow your unconscious to guide you on your journey.

In our day-to-day lives, our unconscious is generally ignored and dismissed as irrelevant. We live in a extermely conscious world. Yet the existence of the unconscious is more provable and more generally accepted than God, the Devil, Heaven and Hell all put together.

Rarely does anyone question the existence of the unconscious. Rarely is there an argument on the existence of the unconscious. Its proof as as simple as drinking from a cup. Reflect on how many muscles were *consciously* controlled to make the cup come to the mouth, the throat swallow the liquid and the hand moving the cup back to the table whence it came. All these actions occur *simultaneously* to the beating of the heart, the lungs breathing and ourselves mentally reflecting on tomorrows weather.

**Not everyone has a soul, but everyone has an unconscious.**

A [soul](https://aeon.co/essays/why-are-most-of-us-stuck-with-a-belief-in-the-soul) might be or it might not. While beliefs differ on the soul, unquestionably everyone has an unconscious. The movement of yours eyes reading this is controlled by the unconscious. No one consciously moves their eyes while reading, we are focused on the words not eyes.

Controlling our arms to pick up a cup. Consciously one has the desire to drink, unconsciously the muscles of our arms, fingers, face and throat are all being coordinated by the unconscious.

Muscle memory of riding a bike. No one consciously rides a bike, they ride the bike from point A to point B, dreaming of the adventures they will have once they arrive at point B.

The Church of Uckoo believes it is just as ridicules to discount the power of the unconscious as it is ridicules to deny the conscious reality of our existence. Therefore: *accept the guidance of the unconscious*.

As the cat falls to its feet, so does our unconscious bring us to where we desire to be. Using this guidance is an essential teaching of the Church of Uckoo.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that the unconscious can be given goals which the unconscious will fulfil but only if we allow the unconscious to guide us. The unconscious can only weave its magic into the golden tapestry of our lives if it is given the space to do so.

**Unconscious is fate by another name.**

Carl Jung [said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/44379-until-you-make-the-unconscious-conscious-it-will-direct-your):

> Make the unconscious conscious, else you will be guided by it and call it fate.

Beware they who do not listen to their unconscious. But how to listen to the unconscious when it does not speak? Our senses allow us to listen to the unconscious, a first step is sharpening and focusing those senses.

The unconscious becomes the bearer of change.

The unconscious provides signs, show us the way with the aid of signposts along the path of our lives. If we miss these signs or ignore them, our life will remain as it is. 

The unconscious speaks to us every moment of our lives, in moments of meditative silence, deep relaxation and reflection we begin to listen to the unconscious.

We all have our own meditative states. You, I, she, it, they, he and we all differ in our methods for reaching this state. There is no single, golden recipe for reaching a meditative state, the communication channels to the unconscious. Meditation becomes the two-way communication channel to the unconscious.

**The distractions of a conscious world.**

We live in a astonishingly conscious world, a world filled with distractions. Advertising, news, scandal and social media all vier for our conscious attention. We are robbed of the quiet, contemplative moments to allow us to listen and experience the unconscious. We are being robbed of [profound boredom](https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/social-media-may-prevent-users-from-reaping-creative-rewards-of-profound-boredom-new-research/) which leads to creativity.

We find it hard to reach the unconscious, the instinctive wisdom that underlies our human existence. Our instinctive selves is denied its true influence on our being. The conscious has become the screaming child, constantly attempting to get our attention, constantly entertaining us with trivialities. Distracting us from the fundamental goal we set ourselves: happiness. However as with our children, we love our conscious to the detriment of ourselves.

Happiness is the goal of each and everyone of us. Happiness takes many forms, be it emotional, financial or possessional. The highest form of happiness is not the spiritual nor the financial, it is the inner happiness, the inner happiness with oneself. 

Ultimate happiness can solely be reached from within oneself. No external influence will light the flame of eternal internal happiness. This simple message is the commonality that unites many if not all spiritual belief systems. Unfortunately not all belief systems explain how to get there nor do they wish their followers to reach this state since it would dissolve the dependency that believers have to that belief system. 

The Church of Uckoo points this splendidly ironic twistification of faith out and additional does not provide a step-by-step guide for reaching inner happiness. Not because the Church of Uckoo does not wish to share, the Church of Uckoo knows that each path, each journey is for each individual to take - on their own. The Church of Uckoo and its founders can only speak of their own journeys but cannot guarantee that application by others will help them on their journey.

As lonely as this might sound, it is joyous and liberating to be your own God on your own path in your own world. Remember: the Church of Uckoo is solely a signpost not an accomodation on your journey.

**Will the conscious ever become more than the unconscious?**

Unless we continuously recall our memories which the unconscious has stored away for us. Only if we consciously move our muscles when we take a cup to drink could the conscious challenge the unconscious it is abilities. Our conscious will remain the overview, the summary of our existence, the alternative would mean being overwhelmed by our own experiences of our existence.

We continually create machines in our own image. Cars, in their simplest forms have a steering wheel, breaks and an accelerator. The rest, the motor, the oil, the petrol are all abstracted away so that we are not overwhelmed by the experience of driving a car. We do not actively think of injecting gas into the engine, nor actively think of cooling the engine using the water from the radiator. All these activities of making an car move have been abstracted away from us. In truth we are so completely and utterly unaware of the workings of a car that we can listen to the radio and talk while driving.

The exact workings of a mobile phone is known by - most probably - no single living person, yet we are all comfortable with using a mobile phone. The complexity is abstracted away. 

And so it is with our existence, the unconscious is the abstraction of reality, our conscious is the window through which we view our existence and reality. Imagine walking through a house, looking through the windows. Each perspective from each window is a constituent of the complexity outside, never the whole. So it is with the conscious.

## Teaching: Dissonance

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cognitive%20dissonance) has this to say:

> **cognitive dissonance**, noun
>> psychological conflict resulting from incongruous beliefs and attitudes held simultaneously

and [this](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dissonance):

> **dissonance**, noun
>> inconsistency between the beliefs one holds or between one's actions and one's beliefs<br>
>> the dissonance between the truth and what people want to believe<br>

Our experience of life's' dissonance begins with birth and ends with death. Why are we born if we are destined to die?

In between those two events, life is contradictory and confusing. We attempt to provide consistency and predictability with our rules, regulations and traditions, but these appear to make it even worse.

Dissonance allows us to see both sides of an argument. It allows us to accept seemingly contradictory ideas and keep them in our heads. The contradictory behaviour of going to work to a job one dislikes but needs to do. The contradictory belief that going to church on Sundays will somehow make having that affair behind your partners back palatable.

Human existence is full of contradictory actions and beliefs - embrace them all and accept them as your very own little children and face the facts in the eyes.

**On Birth, On Death.**

The Church of Uckoo teaches that birth and death are random, unpredictable events, forced upon us by others. Our parents decide when we shall be born, our parents decide how we shall be named, our parents decide our biological gender, our parents decide which epoch we were born into. Others have chosen for us, as we choose for our children.

We are not free to ordain when we will be born nor are we free to ordain when we will die. 

Unless we embrace this dissonance, our underlying doubt why we came to be and our uneasiness with when it all will end causes tension within us. How can I *be* as suddenly as I completely cannot *be*? How can I be *completely* here if in the next moment I might no longer *be*?

It is this dissonance between birth and death that is the ever-burning flame of our deepest fears. Our desires for happiness and our constant search for reason in an unreasoning universe are attempts to paint over this fear.

The Church of Uckoo teaches: *embrace the dissonance before it embraces you*. Use the dissonance to be accepting of others in their confusion and indecision. Believe in the ambivalence of dissonance. 

Dissonance is there but it means no harm, the harm caused by indecision is self-inflicted.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that within the embrace of dissonance lies the basis for broader knowledge and wisdom, the acceptance of meaningless becomes fulfilling. Counterintuitively embracing the dissonance makes existence predictable, predictively fortuitous.

**Indecisiveness of Dissonance.**

The Church of Uckoo teachings are for no one and yet for everyone. The Church of Uckoo accepts dissonance and understands the indecisiveness of dissonance, the Church cannot decide for whom it teaches and why it teaches. It accepts its cosmic yet earthly role. Cosmic is the random unreasoning universe around us, Earth is the predictable reasoning island we attempt to nurture. 

The teachings of the Church of Uckoo provide form to the dissonance that defines our lives. It becomes clear that within this recognition awaits the admittance to cure. Acceptance invites happiness through an appreciation of the human condition.

In dissonance lies indecision, within indecision lies fear, in fear lies hate. Fear is awakened by the undecided future confronting us through our indecision in an contradictory world. The indecision of understanding both sides of an argument, understanding both sides of a decision. Therein lies the asphyxiation of indecision, which option is the best when both are equally good? 

The Church of Uckoo teaches that making a decision does not exclude reversing that decision. Any decision is better than indecision. Flip a coin, if the outcome *feels* wrong, take the other possibility, go against the coin - the coin does not care. We make a decision in going back on the promise we made to the coin.

Coin-based decision making remains decision making, it is as valid as planned, thought out, thought through and any many other forms of decision making. The Church of Uckoo teaches that no decision will ever be final and going back on decisions is as valid as stubbornly going through with decisions one feels are wrong. Decisions make for progress, indecision for worries and fears.

**On Humour.**

The dissonance between humour and seriousness, the line between Yin and Yang. Without us humans this line would not exist. Without us humans the universe would not exist. Without us humans spirituality would not exist. Time, matter, fire, earth, wind and water are all human inventions, and - perhaps - as with the wheel we could do better.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that humour is stronger than seriousness, that reinvention and rediscovery are the only possibilities in a world where everything has been invented. Excluding sliced bread naturally.

The Church of Uckoo lies on the border between Yin and Yang. Between heaven and hell. A border which is immeasurably thin yet immeasurably strong. Tread along that border and be assured that the universe shan't let you fall.

## Teaching: Freedom to Reinvent

The Church of Uckoo asks why has the wheel not been reinvented? Perhaps we have only discovered the simplest of simplest wheels. Our inventions hold us back from our discoveries. Inventions narrow our innovative and explorative horizons, discoveries expand those horizons. Play, experiment and thinking provide the fertile ground for the future.

As children we all invent the wheel. When we first discover the wheel and what it can do for us, we have for ourselves invented the wheel. It is only later when our society, specifically our parents, tell us that it is called a *wheel* that our invention becomes a reinvention.

The freedom to reinvent the wheel is also the freedom to reinvent yourself. Do not be tired down by preconceived ideas and beliefs, find your beliefs and believe in them.

Why do we go by the same names for astrological formations in the sky? Why do we not rename that what has come before us? If we live from the past, our future will be the past.

**On Jesus, On Commercialised Spirituality.**

How would we recognise the return of Jesus? The second coming? How Jesus come to an overpoweringly conscious world and be recognised as *the* spiritual leader? We are forcing Jesus to make one mighty big splash for us to notice or recognise him. 

How many followers on various social media platforms would *@reallyReallyRealJesus* require for the conscious world to take notice of his return? We have not come far in two thousand years of consumer based spirituality.

Spirituality which gives one water but does not reveal where the stream is, makes one depended on their teachings. Each time when one is thirsty, one comes back to be given that glass filled with water. Be aware of the teachings you receive, are your teachers teaching you how to be independent or are your teachers making you dependent? 

You yourself can be your own loving God.

The Church of Uckoo teaches where the stream is, how to make the cups and ideally how to mix the drinks for a good party. The Church of Uckoo would appreciate an invite to a nice party. At the same time, the Church of Uckoo does not care for invites to parties.

Be taught where the streams are, learn where the source of water is and bring your own to-go cup. This is the intention of the Church of Uckoo. When you are thirsty, go to the stream and drink, the Church of Uckoo does not need to be there. Be wise in the knowledge that the Cuckoo is with you, in you and by you.

**On independent followers.**

Everyone should have exactly one follower. Zero is too few, two is one too many, three would be two too many, and four would be ... Who should this follower be? The Church of Uckoo alone and singly follows itself. As you should also solely follow yourself, seek no more followers than yourself.

Singly you can make yourself happy, only you know yourself better than anyone else can and only you should be following yourself. People who claim to know what is best for you are selling you shaving cream. You might need it but secretly you know you won't.

Making ones happiness depended on ones followers will eternally and solidly succeed solely if ones singular follower is oneself. 

## Teaching: Independent Believers

The Church of Uckoo teaches that the church has no followers, no saviours, no saints and no holy men. Except one: you yourself are your saviour, you yourself are your Saint and spiritual guide.

The Church of Uckoo attracts *unfollowers*.

Do not follow the Church of Uckoo is an essential teaching. Find your own loving God within yourself, nurture that God and be assured its just your unconscious fulfilling a need you instinctively seek. Every human has a need for reason and deeper believe, be assured that this need is not the same for everyone.

Trust no one who teaches the wisdoms of the Church of Uckoo. The Church of Uckoo has no preachers, no teachers and no priests, anyone claiming to be such an entity is lying.

**On the Future**

The Church of Uckoo teaches that predicting the future does not concern itself with correctness tomorrow, rather the main concern of predictions is to convince their listeners of something *today*. Predictions made yesterday are seldom recalled or discussed.

So it is with death. There is no life after death but they who preach this are attempting to convince their listeners to act today. The Church of Uckoo teaches that niceness does not depend on the fear of death. Nice and loving behaviour is rewarding for you today, tomorrow and everyday. God does not keep score.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that death is somewhat similar to life however with the lights off and the clocks broken. Without time, thinking ceases. Without time, decay ceases. Without time, life ceases. What remains is the final thought. Your final thought will remain with you for eternity, make it positive, loving and happy thought.

**Of Cuckoos and Stardust**

As the cuckoo lays its eggs in others nests, so too does the Church of Uckoo lay its ideas in other spiritual baskets. The Church does not preach exclusivity nor does the Church of Uckoo desire followers. The Church of Uckoo spreads its message to whom may listen and to those that listen. For those for whom this message makes no sense are equally accepted as those who have understood.

The Church of Uckoo neither forgives nor does it punish. Where no punishment exists, forgiveness is unnecessary. The Church of Uckoo does not perform acts of missionisation, rather the Church of Uckoo performs missionary acts.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that we are all stardust that has come together to form this meaningless existence. Meaninglessness implies that it makes no difference whether moral or immoral, whether egocentric or altruistic. Life is what you make of it. The stardust does not judge.

However honouring those ancient atoms out of which we are formed and respecting their kindness in coming together to form us all and our spaceship Earth, surely that implies being a loving civilisation?

## Teaching: Meaningless & Insignificance

The Church of Uckoo teaches that there is no reason for us to be here. There is no great plan whose foundations has been constructed by an all-mighty God. Plans exist but these plans are individualised within us. It's our plan, our destiny and our will that creates and fulfils our own plan.

Our existence is purely random, meaningless and pointless. 

The Church of Uckoo teaches [insignificance](https://99.99999.fyi/) of existence and the significance of humbleness. Be humble, [be water my friend](https://brucelee.com/podcast-blog/2016/7/20/2-be-water-my-friend). Water becomes the stream, water becomes the cup, become the humble.

Imagine your life as being an empty bottle. As you go through your life, you fill that bottle with dreams, experiences, failures, disasters and happiness. When one dies, one passes this bottle on to ones descendants. They take some of its content and add it to their bottles. Filling ones life bottle with happiness and love will ensure that love and happiness is passed to the generations after us.

**Beware: Arrogance of pointlessness**

Someone who has come to the realisation that life is pointless might begin to become arrogant towards others who have not made or do not wish to make that leap of faith. Respect for all is the teaching of the Church of Uckoo, every belief that isn't externalised and pushed onto others shall be respected.

The Church of Uckoo does not teach the superiority of pointlessness.

Preaching is smug and arrogant, wisdom lies in being asked to speak, wisdom is an act of humbleness. The Church of Uckoo teaches humbleness and respect for all living creatures, dead creatures, aliens and human beings.

The Church of Uckoo does not *take* faith, the Church of Uckoo *gives* faith.

**Altruism**

In a pointless and meaningless existence, altruism as good as being egocentric. But altruism has one major advantage: it makes two people happy. I myself feel good about myself selflessly helping others and the others feel good by being helped. The smile of a helped strange is worth more than millions and millions of printed pieces of paper (or the flickering digital numbers on a screen).

Remember death is worse than flying: you cannot even take carry-on luggage with you. Unlike flying, death will not be bribed into bring along checked-in luggage. Hoarding wealth is as the dammed river: the few drink, the many thirst and wither away. Give away that which you cannot take with you.

## Cuckoo Core Teachings

The Church of Uckoo teaches:

- The unconscious is the underlying spirituality of all other beliefs.

- Embrace the dissonance of a contradictory life, else the dissonance will embrace you.

- Be free to reinvent the wheel, rediscovery, experiment and be not limited by others and their inventions.

- Each believer beliefs in their personal God, the Church of Uckoo is a signpost not a spiritual home on the journey each one of us travels individually.

- Be humble and altruistic as everything is meaningless, pointless and worst of all, we are all singly and collectively insignificance.

These teachings, when followed, can lead to a happy and fulfilled life, or not - your mileage might vary. 

The Church of Uckoo makes no guarantees nor any effort to be correct nor to be holistic nor to be all encompassing.

*Acuckoo? Bless you.*
