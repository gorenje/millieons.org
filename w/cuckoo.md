# Spiritual Church of Cuckoo

## What is the Spiritual Church of Cuckoo?

An non-existential yet existing entity for providing an alternative to the wheel. The repetitive wheel of consumerism that most people in the West are financially forced into.

The Spiritual Church of Cuckoo is the first religion which is also a Startup. We are actively looking for investors and employees to help us with our mission to reach as many people as possible. But reach them not with advertising but the simple message of unconscious dissonance.

The *Spiritual Church of Cuckoo* will hereafter be referred to as *Church of Cuckoo*.

## What is Cuckoo?

Simply put, the *Colt of Unconscious and Conscious Knowledge Of Octagons*.

Octagons represent the eight in Christian believe, the day after the seven days God took to make the universe. As such, it represents the Christian afterlife.

For Moslems the octagon is the interface between heaven and earth, heaven being represented by the circle and the square representing the earth.

For Cuckoo, an octagon is a shape with eight sides. It was the first word that occurred to the founders of Cuckoo that began with 'o' and made a nice abbreviation. That's all.

Yes its *colt* since Cuckoo loves animals in-particular horses. Why else would we chose *cuckoo* as abbreviation?

## Core Belief: Unconscious

At its heart, the Church of Cuckoo postulates that the unconscious is the ultimate fulfiller of our dreams and ambitions.

The unconscious enjoys the exclusivity to be the belief that underlies all other spirituality. If your dream is to become spiritual as the Buddha, your unconscious will join you on that journey. Let the unconscious guide you on that path.

Our unconscious has largely been ignored and dismissed as being irrelevant to our day-to-day lives. Yet its existence is more provable and acceptable than God, the Devil, Heaven and Hell all put together.

Rarely does anyone question the existence of the unconscious. Rarely is there an argument of the existence of the unconscious. Its proof as as simple as picking up a cup and drinking from that cup.

## Not everyone has a soul, but everyone has an unconscious

Not everyone has a [soul](https://aeon.co/essays/why-are-most-of-us-stuck-with-a-belief-in-the-soul), but everyone has an unconscious. The movement of yours eyes reading this is controlled by the unconscious. No one consciously moves their eyes while reading, we are all focused on the words not eye movement.

Controlling our arms to pick up a cup. Consciously one has the desire to drink, unconsciously the muscles of our arms, fingers, face and throat are all being controlled by the unconscious.

Muscle memory of riding a bike. No one consciously thinks about riding a bike, they ride the bike from point A to point B, dreaming of the adventures they will have once they arrive at point B.

It ridicules to discount the power of the unconscious, as it is ridicules to deny the conscious reality of our existence.

## Accept the unconscious guidance

As a cat falls on its feet so does our unconscious bring us to where we desire to be. Acceptance of this guidance is an essential teaching of the Church of Cuckoo.

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that the unconscious can be given goals which, if allowed, the unconscious will fulfil. Only if we allow the unconscious to guide us can it weave its magic into the golden tapestry that is our lives.

## Unconscious is Fate by another name

As Carl Jung said:

> Make the unconscious conscious, else you will be guided by it and call it fate.

Beware they who do not listen to their unconscious. But how to listen to the unconscious when it does not speak? The unconscious speaks in moments of meditative silence and deep relaxation. The unconscious can give signs and provide signposts along the way of our lives.

We all have our own meditative states. You, I, she, it, they, we all differ how we reach this state. There is no single, golden way of reaching a meditative state.

Once there though, the communication channels to the unconscious are opened.

## Distraction of a conscious world

We live in a very conscious world, a world filled with distractions. Advertising, news, scandal and social media are all vying for our conscious attention. We are robbed of the quiet, contemplative moments to allow us to listen and experience the unconscious.

We find it hard to reach the unconscious, the instinctive wisdom that underlies our human existence. Our instinctive existence is denied its true influence on our being.

The conscious has become the screaming child, constantly attempting to get our attention, constantly entertaining us with trivialities. Distracting us from the fundamental goals we set ourselves: happiness.

Happiness is the goal of each and everyone of us. Happiness takes many forms, be it emotional, financial or ownership of something. The highest form of happiness is not the spiritual nor the financial, it is the inner happiness, the inner happiness with oneself.

Ultimate happiness can only be reached from within oneself. There is no reaching it from external sources. This simple message is a commonality of all spiritual belief systems. Unfortunately not all belief systems explain how to get there.

The Church of Cuckoo teaches this but does not provide a step-by-step guide to reaching inner happiness. Not because the Church of Cuckoo does not want to share, the Church of Cuckoo knows that each path, each journey is for each individual to take, on their own.

As lonely as this might sound, it is joyous to be your own God on your own path. The Church of Cuckoo is only a signpost on that path.

## Will the conscious become more than the unconscious?

Unless we continuously think of our memories that the unconscious stores for us. Not unless we consciously move our muscles when we take a cup to drink. Our conscious will remain the overview into our existence else we would be overwhelmed by our own experiences.

We continually create machines in our own image. Cars, in their simplest forms have a steering wheel, breaks and an accelerator. The rest, the motor, the oil, the petrol are all abstracted away so that we are not overwhelmed by the experience of driving a car.

The exact workings of a mobile phone is known by - most probably - no single person, yet we are all comfortable with using a mobile phone. The complexity is abstracted away. So it is with our existence, the unconscious is the abstraction of reality, conscious is the window we look through.

Imagine being in a house and looking through the windows. Each perspective from the window is only a subset of the complexity outside. So it is with the conscious.

## Core Belief: Dissonance

From the book of [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cognitive%20dissonance):

> **cognitive dissonance**, noun
>> psychological conflict resulting from incongruous beliefs and attitudes held simultaneously

From the book of [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dissonance):

> **dissonance**, noun
>> inconsistency between the beliefs one holds or between one's actions and one's beliefs<br>
>> the dissonance between the truth and what people want to believe<br>

Our experience of lifes' dissonance begins with birth and ends with death. In between life is contradictory and confusing.

## On Birth, On Death

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that birth and death are random, unpredictable events, forced upon us by others. Our parents decided when we should be born, our parents decide how we are named, our parents decide our gender, our parents decide which epoch we are born into. Others have chosen us, as we choose for our children.

We are not free to ordain when we will be born nor are we free to ordain when we will die.

Unless we embrace the dissonance, our underlying doubt why we came to be and our uneasiness with when it all ends causes tension within us. How can be suddenly be but at the same time not be completely here since we will die?

It is this dissonance between birth and death that is at the root of our fears, our desires for happiness and our constant search for reason in an unreasoning universe.

Embrace the dissonance before it embraces you. Use the dissonance to be accepting of others in their confusion and indecision. Belief in the ambivalence of dissonance. It is there but it means no harm, the harm caused is self-inflicted.

## Indecisiveness of Dissonance

The Church of Cuckoo teachings are for no one and yet for anyone. The Church of Cuckoo accepts dissonance and understands the indecisiveness of dissonance, the Church cannot decide for whom it teaches and why it teaches. It accepts its cosmic yet earthly role.

The teachings of the Church of Cuckoo give the dissonance that defines our daily lives a form. In recognition lies the admittance to cure.

In dissonance lies indecision, in indecision lies fear, in fear lies hate. Hate comes from jealousy and fear comes from the undecided future facing us.

The indecision of understanding both sides of an argument, understanding both sides of a decision. Therein lies the asphyxiation of indecision, which options is the better?

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that making a decision does not preclude changing that decision. Any decision is better than indecision. Flip a coin, if the outcome *feels* wrong, take the other possibility. One made a decision by going back on a decision made by a coin.

This type of decision making is still called decision making since it is as valid as any other form of decision making. Understand that some decisions need to be forced by having something else make a decision, going back on a decision is still decision making.

## On Humour, On Seriousness.

The dissonance between humour and seriousness, the line between Yin and Yang. Without us humans this line would not exist. Without us humans the universe would not exist. Without us humans spirituality would not exist. Time, matter, fire, earth, wind and water are all human inventions, and perhaps as with the wheel, we could do better.

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that humour is stronger than seriousness, that reinvention and rediscovery are the only possibilities in a world that has invented everything.

Except sliced bread.

## On Yin-Yang

Instinct, feelings - unconscious, fate - the Church of Cuckoo lies on the border between Yin and Yang. Between heaven and hell.

The border that is immeasurable thin yet stronger than the Universe. Walk along the border and be assured you shan't fall.

But if you do fall, the border will become your safety net. Life does not come with punishment, life comes with acceptance of our existence as being completely meaningless, pointless, but yet fulfilling.

The Church of Cuckoo teaches the embracing of dissonance which provides the basis of broader knowledge and wisdom, the acceptance of meaningless is fulfilling, as is every other form of contradiction that makes existence non-predictable.

Dissonance allows us to see both sides of an argument. It allows us to accept seemingly contradictory ideas and keep them in our heads. The contradictory behave of going to work to a job one dislikes but needs to do. The contradictory believe that going to Church on Sundays will make having that affair behind your partners back ok.

Human existence is full of contradictory actions and beliefs - embrace them all and accept them as your very own little children.

## Core Belief: Freedom to Reinvent

The church of cuckoo asks why has the wheel not been reinvented? Perhaps we have only discovered the simplest of simplest wheels. Our inventions hold us back from our discoveries. Inventions narrow our innovative horizons, discoveries expand our horizons. Play, experiment and thinking provide the fertile ground for the future.

As children we all invent the wheel. When we first discover the wheel and what it can do for us, we have for ourselves invented the wheel. It is only later when our society, specifically our parents, tell us that it is called wheel that our invention becomes a reinvention.

The freedom to reinvent the wheel is also the freedom to reinvent yourself. Do not be tired down by preconceived ideas and beliefs, find your beliefs and believe in them.

Why do go by the same names for astrological formation in the sky? Why do we not rename that what has become before us. We live in the past and we live from the past, our future will be the past.

## Why can't the next prophet be an artist?

How would we recognise the return of Jesus? The second coming? How can a spiritual person come to such a conscious world and be recognised as a spiritual leader? We are forcing Jesus to make one mighty big splash for us to notice him.

How many followers on twitter, Instagram and tiktok would Jesus need to have for the conscious world to take notice?

## On Religion

Spirituality which gives one water but does not reveal where the stream is, makes one depended on their teachings. One comes back each time one is thirsty.

Be aware of the teachings you receive, are they teaching you how to be independent or are they making you dependent?

You alone can be your God.

The Church of Cuckoo teaches where the stream is, how to make the cups and ideally how to mix the drinks for a good party. The Church of Cuckoo would appreciate an invite to a nice party. At the same time, the Church of Cuckoo does not care for invites to parties.

Enjoy learning where the streams are, just bring your own cup.

## On Followers

Everyone should have exactly one follower. Zero is too few, two is one too many, three would be two too many, and four would be....

The mystery remains who should this follower be? The Church of Cuckoo alone and only follows itself.

Only you can make yourself happy, only you know yourself better than anyone else can and only you should be following yourself.

People who claim to know what is best for you are selling you shaving cream. You might need it but most probably you know best.

## Core Belief: Independent Believers

The Church of Cuckoo teaches, the church has no followers, no saviours, no saints and no holy men.

Except one: you yourself are your saviour, you yourself are your Saint and spiritual guide.

Don't follow the Church of Cuckoo is an essential teaching. Find your own loving God within yourself, nurture that God and be assured its just your unconscious fulfilling a need you feel and instinctively seek.

Trust no one who teaches the wisdoms of the Church of Cuckoo. The Church of Cuckoo has no preachers, no teachers and no priests, anyone claiming to be such an entity is lying.

## On the Future

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that predicting the future is not about being right tomorrow, rather convincing someone today.

So it is with death, there is no life after death but they who say there is are convincing their listeners to act today.

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that one can be nice without the fear of death hanging over ones head.

The Church of Cuckoo believes death is like life but without the lights on and all clocks standstill. Without time, thoughts cease. Without time, decay ceases. Without time, life ceases. What remains is the last thought.

The last thought will remain with you for eternity, make it a positive, loving thought.

## On Cuckoos

The cuckoo lays its eggs in other nests, so too does the Church of Cuckoo lay its ideas in other spiritual baskets. The Church does not preach exclusivity nor does the Church desire followers.

Neither does the Church of Cuckoo forgive nor does it punish. Where punishment is lacking, forgiveness is unnecessary.

The Church of Cuckoo spreads its message to whom may listen and to those that listen. Those whom the message has not reached are equally as free as those that have been reached.

The Church of Cuckoo does not before acts of missionizing, the Church of Cuckoo only performs missionary acts.

## On Stardust

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that we are all stardust come together for meaningless existence. Meaningless implies it makes no difference whether moral or immoral, whether egocentric or altruistic.

Life is what you make of it. The stardust does not care however honour the ancient material out of which we are made and respect its kindness in coming together to make us all on this spaceship Earth.

## Core Belief: Meaningless

The Church of Cuckoo teaches that there is no reason we are here. There is no great plan whose foundations have been created by a mighty God. Each plan exists individually within us. It's our plan, our destiny and our will that fulfils our plan.

Our existence is purely random, meaningless and pointless.

Imagine life as being an empty bottle that is filled with experiences and happiness. When one dies, one passes this bottle on to ones descendants. They take some of content of ones bottle and add it to theirs.

This is far from pointless but then again, its all imagination.

## Superiority of Pointlessness

The Church of Cuckoo does not teach the superiority of pointlessness which teaches that as someone who has come to the realisation that life is pointless, they begin to become arrogant towards others who haven't made or don't want to make this leap of faith.

Preaching is smug and arrogant, wisdom lies being asked to speak. Wisdom then becomes an act of humbleness.

The Church of Cuckoo teaches humbleness and respect for all creatures, beings and aliens if their exist or if they do not.

## Altruism

In a pointless and meaningless existence, altruism as good as being egocentric. Altruism has one advantage, it makes oneself feel good in helping others. The smile of a helped strange is worth more than millions you leave behind when you die.

Remember: death is even worse than an airport, you cannot even take carry on luggage with you.

## On insignificance

The Church of Cuckoo teaches [insignificance](https://99.99999.fyi/) and the significance of humbleness.

Be humble, be water my friend. Water becomes the stream, water becomes the cup, become the humble.

## Summary Core Beliefs

1. The unconscious is the underlying spirituality of all other beliefs.

2. Embrace the dissonance of a contradictory life, else the dissonance will embrace you.

3. Be free to reinvent the wheel, rediscovery, experiment and do not be limited by others and their inventions.

4. Each believer beliefs in their personal God, the Church of Cuckoo is a signpost not a spiritual home on the journey each one of us travels.

5. Be humble and altruistic as everything is meaningless, pointless and worst of all, we are all insignificance.

## P.S.

The Church of Cuckoo does not speak of Amen, rather *Acuckoo*, to which the appropriate response is *bless you*.
