# Church of Unconscious and Conscious Knowledge of Octagons - Cuckoo

*Cuckoo* is a spiritual start-up providing an alternative to the repetitive prize wheel of consumerism which financially locks humans into cages.

It differs from pyramid schemes in two important ways, first Cuckoo believe in octagons, not pyramids and secondly its a start-up not an get-rich-quick scheme.

Octagons represent the eight in Christian belief, the day after the seven days God took to make the universe, the galaxies, the earth and us. It therefore sometimes represents the Christian afterlife.

For Moslems the octagon is the interface between heaven and earth, heaven being represented by the circle and the square representing the earthly world. The octagon sits neatly between these two locations.

For the Church of Uckoo, an octagon is a shape with eight sides. It was the first word that occurred to the founders of Cuckoo that began with 'o', making for a nice abbreviation. That's all.

The Church of Uckoo maintains five core teachings, these are unconscious, dissonance, reinvention, independency and meaninglessness. Many beliefs stem from these core teachings and these are found in the Commentaries of Cuckoo, otherwise known as *The Book of CoC*.

## Core Teaching: Unconscious

At its heart, the Church of Uckoo postulates that the unconscious is the ultimate fulfiller of our dreams and ambitions. Cuckoo teaches that the unconscious exclusively underlies all other spirituality. To become more spiritual you must allow your unconscious to guide you on that path.

Our unconscious has been ignored and dismissed as irrelevant to our day-to-day lives. We live in a very conscious world. Yet the existence of the unconscious is more provable and more generally accepted than God, the Devil, Heaven and Hell all put together.

Rarely does anyone question the existence of the unconscious. Rarely is there an argument of the existence of the unconscious. Its proof as as simple as drinking from a cup. Reflect on how many muscles were *consciously* controlled to make the cup come to the mouth, the throat swallow the liquid and the hand moving the cup back to the table whence it came. All this happens while the heart continues to beat and we reflect on what the weather will be like tomorrow.

**Not everyone has a soul, but everyone has an unconscious.**

A [soul](https://aeon.co/essays/why-are-most-of-us-stuck-with-a-belief-in-the-soul) might be or it might not. Beliefs differ on the soul however everyone has an unconscious. The movement of yours eyes reading this is controlled by the unconscious. No one consciously moves their eyes while reading, we are focused on the words not eyes.

Controlling our arms to pick up a cup. Consciously one has the desire to drink, unconsciously the muscles of our arms, fingers, face and throat are all being controlled by the unconscious.

Muscle memory of riding a bike. No one consciously thinks about riding a bike, they ride the bike from point A to point B, dreaming of the adventures they will have once they arrive at point B.

The Church of Uckoo describes it as ridicules to discount the power of the unconscious, as it is equivalently ridicules to deny the conscious reality of our existence. Therefore says the Church of Uckoo: *accept the guidance of the unconscious*.

As the cat falls to its feet, so does our unconscious bring us to where we desire to be. Using this guidance is an essential teaching of the Church of Uckoo.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that the unconscious can be given goals which the unconscious can fulfil but only if we allow the unconscious to guide us. The unconscious can weave its magic into the golden tapestry that is our lives only if given the space to do so.

**Unconscious is fate by another name.**

Carl Jung [said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/44379-until-you-make-the-unconscious-conscious-it-will-direct-your):

> Make the unconscious conscious, else you will be guided by it and call it fate.

Beware they who do not listen to their unconscious. But how to listen to the unconscious when it does not speak? Our senses allow us to listen to the unconscious, a first step is to sharpen and focus our senses.

The unconscious provides signs, show us the way with the aid of signposts along the path of our lives. If we miss these signs our lives will remain as they are, happy and isolated.

The unconscious speaks to us every moment of our lives, in moments of meditative silence, deep relaxation and reflection we begin to listen to the unconscious.

We all have our own meditative states. You, I, she, it, they, we all differ how we reach this state. There is no single, golden recipe of reaching this meditative state, the communication channels to the unconscious. Meditation then becomes the two-way communication channel to the unconscious.

**The distractions of a conscious world.**

We live in a very conscious world, a world filled with distractions. Advertising, news, scandal and social media are all vying for our conscious attention. We are robbed of the quiet, contemplative moments to allow us to listen and experience the unconscious. We are robbed of [profound boredom](https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/social-media-may-prevent-users-from-reaping-creative-rewards-of-profound-boredom-new-research/).

We find it hard to reach the unconscious, the instinctive wisdom that underlies our human existence. Our instinctive existence is denied its true influence on our being. The conscious has become the screaming child, constantly attempting to get our attention, constantly entertaining us with trivialities. Distracting us from the fundamental goals we set ourselves: happiness. But we still love that child.

Happiness is the goal of each and everyone of us. Happiness takes many forms, be it emotional, financial or possession. The highest form of happiness is not the spiritual nor the financial, it is the inner happiness, the inner happiness with oneself. 

Ultimate happiness can only be reached from within oneself. There is no reaching it from external sources. This simple message is a commonality of all spiritual belief systems. Unfortunately not all belief systems explain how to get there nor do they want you to get there. 

The Church of Uckoo teaches this but does not provide a step-by-step guide to reaching inner happiness. Not because the Church of Uckoo does not want to share, the Church of Uckoo knows that each path, each journey is for each individual to take, on their own. The Church of Uckoo and its founders can only speak of their own journeys.

As lonely as this might sound, it is joyous and liberating to be your own God on your own path in your own world. Remember: the Church of Uckoo is only a signpost on that path.

**Will the conscious become more than the unconscious?**

Unless we continuously recall our memories which the unconscious has stored away for us. Only if we consciously move our muscles when we take a cup to drink could the conscious challenge the unconscious it is abilities. Our conscious will remain the overview, the summary of our existence, the alternative would be being overwhelmed by our own experiences and existence.

We continually create machines in our own image. Cars, in their simplest forms have a steering wheel, breaks and an accelerator. The rest, the motor, the oil, the petrol are all abstracted away so that we are not overwhelmed by the experience of driving a car. We do not actively think of pumping gas into the engine, actively think of cooling the engine with radiator water. All these activities of making an car move have been abstracted away from us. In fact, we are so unaware of how a car works that we can listen to radios and talk while driving.

The exact workings of a mobile phone is known by - most probably - no single person, yet we are all comfortable with using a mobile phone. The complexity is abstracted away. So it is with our existence, the unconscious is the abstraction of reality and our conscious is the window we look through at that existence.

Imagine being in a house and looking through the windows. Each perspective from the window is only a subset of the complexity outside. So it is with the conscious.

## Core Teaching: Dissonance

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cognitive%20dissonance) has this to say:

> **cognitive dissonance**, noun
>> psychological conflict resulting from incongruous beliefs and attitudes held simultaneously

and [this](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dissonance):

> **dissonance**, noun
>> inconsistency between the beliefs one holds or between one's actions and one's beliefs<br>
>> the dissonance between the truth and what people want to believe<br>

Our experience of life's' dissonance begins with birth and ends with death. Why are we born if we are destined to die?

In between those two events, life is contradictory and confusing. We attempt to provide consistency and predictability with our rules and regulation, but they appear to make it even worse.

Dissonance allows us to see both sides of an argument. It allows us to accept seemingly contradictory ideas and keep them in our heads. The contradictory behaviour of going to work to a job one dislikes but needs to do. The contradictory belief that going to Church on Sundays will make having that affair behind your partners back somehow ok.

Human existence is full of contradictory actions and beliefs - embrace them all and accept them as your very own little children.

**On Birth, On Death.**

The Church of Uckoo teaches that birth and death are random, unpredictable events, forced upon us by others. Our parents decide when we shall be born, our parents decide how we are named, our parents decide our gender, our parents decide which epoch we are born into. Others have chosen us, as we choose for our children.

We are not free to ordain when we will be born nor are we free to ordain when we will die. 

Unless we embrace the dissonance, our underlying doubt why we came to be and our uneasiness with when it all ends causes tension within us. How can be suddenly be but at the same time not be completely here since we will die?

It is this dissonance between birth and death that is at the root of our fears, our desires for happiness and our constant search for reason in an unreasoning universe.

The Church of Uckoo teaches: *embrace the dissonance before it embraces you*. Use the dissonance to be accepting of others in their confusion and indecision. Belief in the ambivalence of dissonance. It is there but it means no harm, the harm caused is self-inflicted.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that the embracing of dissonance is that which provides the basis for broader knowledge and wisdom, the acceptance of meaningless becomes fulfilling, as is every other form of contradiction that makes existence unpredictable.

**Indecisiveness of Dissonance.**

The Church of Uckoo teachings are for no one and yet for everyone. The Church of Uckoo accepts dissonance and understands the indecisiveness of dissonance, the Church cannot decide for whom it teaches and why it teaches. It accepts its cosmic yet earthly role. Cosmic is the random unreasoning universe around us, earth is the predictable reasoning island we live on. 

The teachings of the Church of Uckoo provide form to the dissonance that defines our daily lives. With that it becomes clear that within recognition awaits the admittance to cure. Acceptance invites happiness through an appreciation of the human condition.

In dissonance lies indecision, within indecision lies fear, in fear lies hate. Fear is awakened by the undecided future confronting us through our indecision in an contradictory world. The indecision of understanding both sides of an argument, understanding both sides of a decision. Therein lies the asphyxiation of indecision, which options is the better when both are good? 

The Church of Uckoo teaches that making a decision does not preclude changing that decision. Any decision is better than indecision. Flip a coin, if the outcome *feels* wrong, take the other possibility, go against the coin - the coin does not care! We have made a decision by going back on the decision made by the coin.

Coin-based decision making remains decision making, it is as valid as planned, thought out, thought through and any other form of decision making. The Church of Uckoo teaches that no decision will ever be final and going back on decisions is as valid as stubbornly going through with decisions one feels are wrong. Decisions make for progress, indecision for worries and fears.

**On Humour, On Seriousness.**

The dissonance between humour and seriousness, the line between Yin and Yang. Without us humans this line would not exist. Without us humans the universe would not exist. Without us humans spirituality would not exist. Time, matter, fire, earth, wind and water are all human inventions, and perhaps as with the wheel, we could do better.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that humour is stronger than seriousness, that reinvention and rediscovery are the only possibilities in a world where everything has been invented. Of course, except sliced bread.

The Church of Uckoo lies on the border between Yin and Yang. Between heaven and hell. A border which is immeasurably thin yet immeasurably strong. Tread along that border and be assured that the universe shan't let you fall.

# Core Teaching: Freedom to Reinvent

The Church of Uckoo asks why has the wheel not been reinvented? Perhaps we have only discovered the simplest of simplest wheels. Our inventions hold us back from our discoveries. Inventions narrow our innovative and explorative horizons, discoveries expand our horizons. Play, experiment and thinking provide the fertile ground for the future.

As children we all invent the wheel. When we first discover the wheel and what it can do for us, we have for ourselves invented the wheel. It is only later when our society, specifically our parents, tell us that it is called a *wheel* that our invention becomes a reinvention.

The freedom to reinvent the wheel is also the freedom to reinvent yourself. Do not be tired down by preconceived ideas and beliefs, find your beliefs and believe in them.

Why do go by the same names for astrological formation in the sky? Why do we not rename that what has become before us. We live in the past and we live from the past, our future will be the past.

**On Jesus, On Commercialised Spirituality.**

How would we recognise the return of Jesus? The second coming? How can a spiritual person come to such a conscious world and be recognised as a spiritual leader? We are forcing Jesus to make one mighty big splash for us to notice him. 

How many followers on various social media platforms would Jesus be required to have for the conscious world to take notice of his return? We have not come far in two thousand years of consumer based spirituality.

Spirituality which gives one water but does not reveal where the stream is, makes one depended on their teachings. Each time when one is thirsty, one comes back to be given that glass filled with water. Be aware of the teachings you receive, are they teaching you how to be independent or are they making you dependent? 

You alone can be your God.

The Church of Uckoo teaches where the stream is, how to make the cups and ideally how to mix the drinks for a good party. The Church of Uckoo would appreciate an invite to a nice party. At the same time, the Church of Uckoo does not care for invites to parties.

Be taught where the streams are and bring your own cup. This is the intention of the Church of Uckoo.

**On independent followers.**

Everyone should have exactly one follower. Zero is too few, two is one too many, three would be two too many, and four would be ... The mystery remains who should this follower be? The Church of Uckoo alone and only follows itself. As you should also follow only yourself and seek no extra followers.

Only you can make yourself happy, only you know yourself better than anyone else can and only you should be following yourself. People who claim to know what is best for you are selling you shaving cream. You might need it but secretly you know you won't.

# Core Teaching: Independent Believers

The Church of Uckoo teaches that the church has no followers, no saviours, no saints and no holy men. Except one: you yourself are your saviour, you yourself are your Saint and spiritual guide.

The Church of Uckoo attracts *unfollowers*.

Do not follow the Church of Uckoo is an essential teaching. Find your own loving God within yourself, nurture that God and be assured its just your unconscious fulfilling a need you instinctively seek. Every human has a need for reason and deeper believe, be assured that this need is not the same for everyone.

Trust no one who teaches the wisdoms of the Church of Uckoo. The Church of Uckoo has no preachers, no teachers and no priests, anyone claiming to be such an entity is lying.

**On the Future**

The Church of Uckoo teaches that predicting the future does not concern itself with correctness tomorrow, rather predictions concern themselves with convincing their listeners today. Predictions made yesterday are seldom remembered.

So it is with death. There is no life after death but they who preach this are attempting to convince their listeners to act today. The Church of Uckoo teaches that niceness does not depend on the fear of death. Nice and loving behaviour is rewarding for you today, tomorrow and everyday. God does not keep score.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that death is somewhat similar to life however with the lights off and the clocks broken. Without time, thinking ceases. Without time, decay ceases. Without time, life ceases. What remains is the final thought. Your final thought will remain with you for eternity, make it positive, loving and happy thought.

**Of Cuckoos and Stardust**

The cuckoo lays its eggs in others nests, so too does the Church of Uckoo lay its ideas in other spiritual baskets. The Church does not preach exclusivity nor does the Church of Uckoo desire followers. The Church of Uckoo spreads its message to whom may listen and to those that listen. For those whom this message does not compute are equally as free as those that have been reached.

The Church of Uckoo neither forgives nor does it punish. Where no punishment exists, forgiveness is unnecessary. The Church of Uckoo does not perform acts of missionizing, the Church of Uckoo only performs missionary acts.

The Church of Uckoo teaches that we are all stardust come together for this meaningless existence. Meaninglessness implies that it makes no difference whether moral or immoral, whether egocentric or altruistic. Life is what you make of it. The stardust does not care.

However honour the ancient atoms out of which we are made and respect its kindness in coming together to form us all on this spaceship Earth.

# Core Teaching: Meaningless & Insignificance

The Church of Uckoo teaches that there is no reason we are here. There is no great plan whose foundations have been created by a mighty God. Each plan exists individually within us. It's our plan, our destiny and our will that creates and fulfils our own plan.

Our existence is purely random, meaningless and pointless. 

The Church of Uckoo teaches [insignificance](https://99.99999.fyi/) of existence and the significance of humbleness. Be humble, be water my friend. Water becomes the stream, water becomes the cup, become the humble.

Imagine life as being an empty bottle that is filled with experiences and happiness. When one dies, one passes this bottle on to ones descendants. They take some of content of ones bottle and add it to theirs.

This is far from pointless but then again, its all imagination and faith.

**Superiority of Pointlessness**

The Church of Uckoo does not teach the superiority of pointlessness. Someone who has come to the realisation that life is pointless, their might begin to become arrogant towards others who haven't made or don't want to make this leap of faith. Respect for all is the teaching of the Church of Uckoo.

Preaching is smug and arrogant, wisdom lies being asked to speak, wisdom is an act of humbleness. The Church of Uckoo teaches humbleness and respect for all creatures, beings and aliens if their exist or if they do not.

**Altruism**

In a pointless and meaningless existence, altruism as good as being egocentric. Altruism has one advantage, it makes oneself feel good in helping others. The smile of a helped strange is worth more than millions of dollars you leave behind when you die.

Remember: death is even worse than an airport, you cannot even take carry on luggage with you.

## Summary Core Teachings

The Church of Uckoo teaches these five core teachings:

1. The unconscious is the underlying spirituality of all other beliefs.

2. Embrace the dissonance of a contradictory life, else the dissonance will embrace you.

3. Be free to reinvent the wheel, rediscovery, experiment and do not be limited by others and their inventions.

4. Each believer beliefs in their personal God, the Church of Uckoo is a signpost not a spiritual home on the journey each one of us travels.

5. Be humble and altruistic as everything is meaningless, pointless and worst of all, we are all singly and collectively insignificance.

These teachings, when followed, provide the basis for a happy and fulfilled life. Or not, your mileage might vary. The Church of Uckoo comes with no guarantees and makes not effort to be correct nor holistic.

*Acuckoo!*

*Bless you*.
