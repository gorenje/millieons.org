## The Silent Paradox

It is our fears of lions that we project into the universe. But we have long lost that fear of lions since now lions are stuck behind bars in zoos, there are no more lions to jump out and bite us. Yet we maintain our fear. Is time to let go of those fears that remain to haunt us?

Instead we continue to assume that the universe is hostile and out to get us. We even go as far as developing theories that the silence is a sign of aggression - see the [*The Three Body Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)). The theory being that it is silent because everyone is keeping a head down since as soon as you make a noise, someone will come along and will be nasty to you. Sssshhhhh, they might hear us!

The ironic paradox is that the universe is a loud place. Communication is going on constantly. There are constant communication between other species, aliens and bug-eyed monsters. How can I say this? Simple, if we don't hear anything it does not mean there is no communication. Again this is an assumption of humankind that we take from here (our planet) and project into the universe.

We are the "smartest" animals on the planet, we hear nothing, therefore it must be silent. QED.

From the flat earth to the earth revolving around sun, our assumptions have time after time been proven wrong yet we persist in making assumptions about things that we have no deeper conception about. Which is what makes us humans: we make assumptions and create theories to explain our collective reality. Fine, good survival strategy. Unfortunately, these theories sometimes blend us from taking other approaches. The Christian Church enforced a blind spot on society when it said the sun rotates around the earth. No one dared to question that, hence a lie became collective truth.

Taking the assumption that the universe is a loud place, how come we don't hear anything? Simple: we listen in ways that is not compatible to the communication methods. We are using listening methods, here come our assumptions again, in which we *assume* everyone else out there would communicate. But what if they communicate in a utterly different way? Well then the universe would appear to be silent.

And there we have it: the premise *the universe is silent* can be concluded from either "yes we listen, we hear nothing therefore it's silent" or "we listen in the wrong way and therefore it would appear to be silent". We can't prove it either way, we end up assuming that no one out there is communicating.

Supposing the latter conclusion is correct, then how should we be listening? I don't know. Instead we might be better off asking how does everyone else out there communicate? Might they communicate in particular way that we well never infer unless we make societal changes?

And this is the core of what I would like to say: we humans are a competitive and destructive race. We have collectively brought many species to extinction, we have destroyed much of the environment and we know face a catastrophic climate change. We continue to live in a "them and us" world: nature is ours to control, aliens are out to get us, and those who suffer have themselves to blame.

What if the universe is a place where after millions of years of evolution, species have come to realise that instead of one-against-all, it is better to be all-for-one. It is better to be altruist and share instead of hoarding and fighting over resources and knowledge. What if the these aliens have come with a communication mechanism that can singularly be understood by fellow altruist motivate species?

Yes that is right: a communication method that, to be understood, requires a societal form that consists of altruism, peace, harmony and respect. 

Many might say this is ridiculous and well it may be. It is just as ridiculous as believing that a societal form that is based on altruism could ever work, provided one excludes the Buddhist.
