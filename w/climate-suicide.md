## Climate Suicide

<img src="/f/i/climate-suicide.svg"/>

It is sad to think of and harder to prevent however suicide will be the next logical (but stupid) step in the battle between climate activists and climate changers.

With the slogan *removing myself from the climate imbalance* one would be performing the ultimate altruist act. Removing oneself from a population that is changing the climate would be one small symbolic step (considering a population of eight billion) but an extreme act of civil disobedience and personal sacrifice.

Observing the trends amongst climate activist, it is clear that their actions are getting extremer each day. From gluing themselves to streets and blocking rescue vehicles (unintentionally) to gluing themselves to works of art across galleries around the global. Frustrations amongst activists must be comparably extreme. 

It is unfortunate that the worlds media, instead of addressing the causes of these extreme acts prefer to discuss the symptoms - the damage caused to objects, the disruption to societal order, the number of arrests, the imprisonments.

The worlds political class pays lip service to a topic that has been with us for over fifty years. Even worse, few realise that [climate change studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science) have been with us since the later 19th century.

[Rishi Sunak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak) (the at-the-time-of-writing prime minister of the UK) highlights this lip service by first refusing to go to the [COP27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference) climate conference and then under public pressure, he does a backflip. That is well and good however he could have said that he would attend *online* - that is, do not fly to Egypt but instead keep the carbon dioxide in the ground and attend online, using a technology fine-tuned during the Covid pandemic.

It is ironic and sad to have a climate conference occurring in-person instead of online. As an additional bonus if it were  online-only conference, we - as world citizens - could have all attended instead of the selected few.

I as an observer find it sad and dystopian to wake in the morning to news of war, destruction and climate disaster only to then read of global leaders flying halfway around the world to attend a climate conference sponsored by Coca-Cola.
