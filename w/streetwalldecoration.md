## Streetwalldecoration

**Ingredients**:

1 Part Rubber Glove<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- latex one-way could be an option<br>
1 Part Spray Can<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- red tone is closer to the truth<br>
1 Part Wall<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- any wall that can be legally decorated<br>

**Instructions**:

*Step 1*: Pull on the rubber glove, ensuring that it is not the same hand that will hold the spray can! Although having gloves on both hands is also an option :)

*Step 2*: Place the gloved hand onto the wall, holding the wall. Spread the fingers apart on that hand.

*Step 3*: Engage spray can aiming at the hand holding the wall.

*Step 4*: Take off the glove and dispose of it responsibly.

*Step 5*: Rinse and Repeat as often as possible.

**Result**:

You are now looking at one of the very first forms of art that humans ever created. The very first cave-dwelling humans decorated their cave walls with the same motive.

Reflect a moment on how far we humans have come and yet how primitive we remain. Reflect on the disconnect between us and those caves. Reflect on technology and how our primitive brains deal with the advances we have made in our tooling. 

Instead of mixing orca tones that can be found naturally in our surroundings, we take a spray can created in a factory halfway around the world. Using the spray can releases deadly gases that destroy our habitat. And since the colour does not rinse off, we need a glove.

That we collectively call technological advancement.
