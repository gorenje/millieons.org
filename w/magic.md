## Magic

Magic makes money.

Things,Stuff,Ideas,Objects,... that are hard to [understand](/w/led), that is they are akin to magic, can be sold to the highest bidder.

Notice understanding is not [explaining](/w/explain).

### Witchcraft used to make money

Ironically in medieval Germany apparently magic really did make money. This [aeon article](https://aeon.co/essays/how-economic-behaviour-drove-witch-hunts-in-pre-modern-germany) describes how witches who met with dragons. These dragons would bring the witch something of value.

> A number of people maintained that they had seen the dragon: it looked like a long burning beam with a thick, cow-like head that soared through the night sky. Flying into a house through a window or through the chimney, the dragon brought its master or mistress money as well as other readily usable or saleable goods such as grain, milk or butter.

The article makes the suggestion that there was a certain class of witches, mainly male, who were in fact entrepreneurs. These were called dragon witches.

The article then poses the question:

> Did the rise of capitalism marginalise the belief in witchcraft?

Well, I've heard capitalism being blamed for many failures but for a disbelief in  witchcraft?
