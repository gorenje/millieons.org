       +---------------------- Doesnâ€™t matter <-------+
```

We're all made of space matter, the ingredients for planets, suns and universes, ancient matter is within us all.

That matters, that matters as we play our part and we become part of the intricate workings of the universe. We become a small but important part of the universe, without us, you and me, the universe would be a different place.

The universe is a vast collective of matter, antimatter, dark-matter and us. So much matter that we sometimes lose sight of the most important matter in the universe, in our existence. That being the abundant but regularly overseen *doesn't* matter.

Doesn't matter constitutes the vast majority of our lives. Be it sleeping, eating, shitting or dying. It doesn't matter is what shapes us and our lives, no one cares, certainly not a fictive, imaginary creature called God.
