## Understanding doesn't explain itself

Explaining something it terms of what you understand will usually lead to misunderstanding. Explaining something in terms of what the other person understands will lead to consensus.

No matter how simple something might be, no two people have the same background in understanding and experience. Explanation should therefore be based on commonality in understanding.
