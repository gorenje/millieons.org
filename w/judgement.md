## Judgement

Here's a joke:

Two alcoholics go into a bar and sit down. They both order their drinks.

Says the one alcoholic to the other: You are an alcoholic.

Says the other alcoholic: No.

That might not be a particular good joke but at least it got your attention. The philosophical question is which alcoholic is correct?

The first or second or are both right or both wrong? Perhaps that narrator is wrong and neither are actually alcoholics?

And who is exactly does the first alcoholic think they are in accusing the other of being an alcoholic? Perhaps that alcoholic would have told the joke as: an alcoholic and a church-going, god-fearing believer in Christianity go into a bar together.

Or perhaps the first alcoholic would have told the joke as: a successful but worried capitalist and a struggling but happy artist walk into a bar together.

So the next time you have the feeling you have to judge someone, ask yourself who is doing the judging? You or the society around you? Or your belief-system? Or your own personal fears? 

This is important since the person you are judging will always just see you *doing the* judgement, they do not understand your source of that judgement. They will always blame *you* for your judgement, not your fears, beliefs, society, family or green aliens from the outer-sphere that you saw on your lawn last night.

Take a stand and try accepting and understanding instead of judging.
