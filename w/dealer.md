## Dealer

```
Pickup the believer;

I’ll make you a receiver;

Your own personal dealer.
```

This is an homage (not to mention bastardisation) of [Personal Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Jesus). Pro tip: Even depeche mode said that the johnny cash version was the best.

*Most people are different in the same way. The rest are just the same.*
