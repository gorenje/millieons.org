## An Ode to drunken people

It's done  - the glass  
I'm done  - the spirit  
We are done - the relationship.

It's over and I'm not sorry about it. I am glad, very glad that I *have* to recognise the destructive nature that underlies you, your character and your being.

I am sorry that you only see self-pity and have not the strength to accept those failings that make my life a misery. We have spoken, you have acknowledged my pain. Yet you persist in pouring salt into a wound that was healing. 

I cannot,  
I will not,  
I shan't accept that pain - any longer.

I will not accept apologies or excuses. These things do not happen because of alcohol, these things are magnified by alcohol but they are always there. Those issues that each one of us carry around with us are not particular nor special nor in any way unique to you. 

Your problems do not make you special.

Your problems do not justify your behaviour when you are drunk.

Your problems need to be dealt with. I am not your therapist. I am not your psychologist. Deal with them but without me.

You are living a lie when you apologise. You are not capable of dealing with your behaviour when you have had too much to drink. You are an unpleasant, embarrassing, provoking drinker who enjoys being those most horrid of characteristics. But it is only the alcohol, as you claim, it isn't you.

The next morning brings the sweet tranquility of alcoholic induced blackout. The memories are gone, the lull between drinks returns. But the pain that you have spread in your drunken state remains, remains with those around you. 

They didn't forget, they won't forget and they can't forget.

Memories of those around you, the ones you have hurt, linger, not dispersing. These memories bury themselves deep into the minds of the hurt.

You might well manage to behave when in public, hence the uncomprehending looks of my friends when I say I am through. I do not mind. I know your behaviour as soon as the door closes behind us. We are home, you feel safe. I know the nastiness that engulfs you then. There is only one outlet for this. Only one sink to capture and absorb this.

Me.

Perhaps had you spent more time protecting yourself as I now protect myself, you might have been a better person. The failure to look after oneself leads to hurting others, embarrassing yourself and losing friends.

Goodbye and please do not ever contact me again.
