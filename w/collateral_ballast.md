## Collateral Ballast

The slow and painful death of consumerism and globalised manufacturing is leading to the new era of collateral ballast.

The failure of capitalism has left an entire class of consumers out in the cold. Consumers who can no longer consumer as there is no more credit, no more jobs and no more money. 

Money has been drained out of the system, never to flow back down to the working classes aka consumers. Blood of the system, money, has been hoovered up and frozen into large powerful banks, controlled by the very rich. And when blood stops following the result is the death of the host. 

When money is controlled not by the state but by the rich and powerful, where does the desire come to support the poor and less well-off? From nowhere, there is no desire for the rich to support the poor. The rich don't need the poor. Although one could argue that if there are no poor, who is rich? Rich are only rich because they can compare themselves to the poor - it's the comparison that makes the rich, rich.

Money stagnates, capitalism freezes.  

This unfortunate happenstance was never planned nor desired, the true believers in capitalism believed in an indefinitely continuation. Who would have thought that in just a few generations (one or two, is it even a plural?) the house of cards would collapse and the world would be facing a crisis of *ballast*?

It is of course unpleasant to think of people as ballast but economically that is exactly what is happening. Economically speaking most humans are cattle. To be herded together and made to plough the fields. And the system now has too many cattle for too few fields.

Ironically the elephant in the room is human inefficiencies. We don't have too few resources, we have too much waste. Humans, as a species, are incredibly inefficient. We eat only to shit half of that out again. We drink to piss half of that out again. Its all wasted down the drain. Why is this? Because humans weren't designed to live as we do. In cities, as sedentary individuals in cold rooms in multistory high-rise buildings. Humans were designed to live in small communities as hunter-gatherers. In such a setting, our human inefficiencies were perfectly integrated into the larger environment. 

What now has happened is that we have projected our inefficiencies into the products we make and manufacturing methods we use to make these products. Why do cars stand around rusting for 80 to 90 percent of their lifetime? Why does everyone need a washing machine that is used once or twice a week for a few hours? How much food does a typical restaurant throw out? Expiration dates of foods that basically are still eatable but because a date has come around, the food needs to be thrown out. Mobile phones that get replaced not because the hardware is somehow broken or not capable of doing the job but because inefficiencies of software causes the mobile phone to become redundant.

The list is endless. In combination with the expectation of everyone single one of us to have everything we ever desired, we multiple human designed inefficiencies to the point of system collapse - both environmentally and financially.

And why do we have these desires? Do we truly want to be better than our neighbours - better shoes, better cloths, better lifestyle, better cars, better "betters"? Our neighbours who are our fellow astronauts on spaceship Earth? Why do we have this continual need for better "betters"?  Why does advertising tells us that we need brand X to have feature Y that your neighbour doesn't have? Or product A will make you a happier person? Why do we care?

Advertising, the cattle probe of capitalism. We believe advertising provides *adv*ise on new products, instead advertising has become an instrument for industrial manipulation of the consumer class, creating fake desires and needs. Advertising uses negative human emotions - jealousy, envy, self-doubt, lust, greed, ... - to drain financial freedoms from the consumer class who end up trapped in a rat-race to the bottom. Consumers who are confined in a financial cage of debt (some call it credit), worry, stress and work. Endlessly looping inside the hamster wheel which from the inside, appears as the career ladder that everyone seeks to climb.

We are the cattle being lead to our own slaughter by advertising. We are no longer consumers, we are becoming the cattle class. We have lost out financial free will for the sack of having the latest and greatest mobile phone.

Why collateral? The ruling class that are blind to the collapse of capitalism but smart enough to drain it of the resources that we all need, take the creation of ballast into account and then apply Darwinian principles - misunderstood unfortunately - of survival of the fittest. Of course this is economically and market based, so the ballast becomes anonymous numbers in a spreadsheet somewhere. This is not particularly inventive nor modern, there were and will always be slaves in a system based on profits.

Even the words "collateral" and "ballast" are related to waste: collateral damage the unfortunate death of humans - wasting of human lives. And ballast is pointless crap that a boat needs so that it is not empty on a return trip. 

## Narratives from an Orwellian State

*We couldn't imagine a collapse happening but now that it has happened, we can't do anything because we don't have the financial resources.*

This simple narrative is repeated year after year, across all facades of human existence. Climate change, globalisation, the industrial military complex, the internet, bureaucracy and politics. Everywhere where one looks the narrative is always the same. Unless of course you happen to be a bank. Or the industrial military complex: "we have no money for schools but suddenly out of nowhere there is a spare billion or two for purchasing military hardware".

If you think this is rather over dramatising the situation, then you're probably one of those people also doesn't have an issue with ordering everything on amazon and then have an extremely inefficient delivery process bring that stuff to your front door within hours. Or someone who can afford to purchase the latest and greatest gadget to fulfil a desire that was artificially implanted into their minds by the advertising industry which tracks your search history to show you just those products that your searched for. And then even provide enough data to sellers to artificially inflate the price, since the seller also knows you want to purchase the product. (Hint: try a) deleting your cookies, b) factory resetting your computer/phone, c) using a different internet connection and d) then going directly to the sellers page - e'Voila a cheaper price!)

Does it get anymore Orwellian than having an advertising industry track you in order to create an artificial *desire* in your mind to purchase something that you will never actually *need*? 

The irony is that the frog is smart enough to spring out of the sauce pan when the water gets hot (it is an urban legend that it doesn't), humans don't even realise that they are in a sauce pan (Earth), let alone that the water is getting hot (climate change). 

People like Elon Musk believe that we can simply escape our future by, for example, colonising Mars. But wait? Who caused all the problems we are facing here? Could it be the same human species that is planning to colonies Mars? Hm, what could possible go wrong? The alternative seems to be [bunkers under deserts](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/sep/04/super-rich-prepper-bunkers-apocalypse-survival-richest-rushkoff).

## Finally coming to the point

*The working class became the consumer class and the consumer class will become collateral ballast on the economically system.*

Humans will become economical ballast needing retirement plans, medical care and infrastructure for fornication, ingestion and taking dumps. All these things require investment and upkeep. For humans who no longer possess the financial ability to consumer. 

## Clarification

Just to clarify, this article describes *trends* in "Western" society - of course there is still a working class however with automation and out-sourcing, it is shrinking. And the working class isn't disappearing globally, western workers are being automated away or out sourced to where wages are the cheapest. 

It is this trend, in part, that made China so rich - cheap labour, no environmental regulation and no labour protection laws. On the other hand, was this trend triggered by China having cheap labour? Actually no, it's always been this way and will always stay that way: in world where profit is the only measure of success, production will go there where labour is the financially cheapest.
