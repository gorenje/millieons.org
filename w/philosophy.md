## Philosophy

[Epicureanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism) - enjoy life and stay out of politics.

[Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) - enjoy the moment and don't fear pain.

[Fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism) - don't do anything proactively since fate has the upper hand.

[Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism) - it's all bullshit, get on with it.

## Aliens and Philosophy

Why is the *Great Maker In The Sky* (i.e. God) the only alien that philosophers discuss? Why isn't there an active branch of philiosophy that deals with the concept of aliens and what would happen if aliens contacted us.

Or is there a branch? Are perhaps Sci-Fi authors the original philosophers? I would like to think so.

Even though, it would be nice if philosophers could take other aliens just as serious they have the *Great Maker In The Sky*. For two thousand years there has been a constant discussion about what God is and whether he's made of store or light or bananas or whatever. Who created him? Etc. Incredible how much time has been wasted trying to explain "God".
