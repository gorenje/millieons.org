## Is opening and filming the contents of others lost luggage an immoral act?

Purchasing lost luggage at airports and opening their contents on [YouTube (german)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRlnhmv8RgY) has become a thing. Judging by the amount of advertising, the voyeurs of this world enjoy watching this stuff. (And yes, watching other people opening the luggage of third parties is, to a certain extent, voyeurism.)

NOTES: 

1) The video above is a random example and I am not affiliated nor in any other way connected to the people who made that video.

2) I am not criticising anyone for doing this nor for watching this, I merely wish to draw attention to this and point out that people don't lose their luggage for fun nor for profit of others.

### Airports

It seems that airports have a real issue with lost luggage. Since Covid, it seems, airports have been struggling to handle the quantities of luggage. I personally know of one airport (not mentioning any names here) which has an entire hanger full of lost luggage. They don't scan the baggage tags and they don't notify the passengers that their luggage has arrived. Instead a passenger may (provided they have the correct documentation) enter the hanger and search for their luggage, and this they do on their own whim: they aren't notified, they have to go to the airport and search by themselves.

Since they don't get notified by the airport, there are quite a few people who never actually realise that their luggage has arrived and is waiting for them. Since they make the assumption that the airport will notify them upon the arrival of their lost luggage.

In addition, finding your luggage in a hanger full with other peoples luggage is non-trivial task. So even if people do turn up at the airport requesting their luggage, they are most probably overwhelmed by the sight of a hanger full of lost luggage.

Of course, I assume this is not the case for the majority of airports. I have heard of one major airport (as described above) but have also heard of others that have similar issues. I make the assumption that not all airports have these issues nor deal with lost luggage in the same manner. 

### Personal items

I have not viewed any videos on YouTube (not even the one linked in this article) and perhaps all people posting these video avoid personal items, I do not know. However if you imagine that someone on YouTube opens your bag and finds your dirty underwear or your personal sexual aids or your holiday gifts for those distant relations or whatever else you placed in that bag, how would you feel about it?

I know of at least one person who has a psychological fear of having her lost bag being opened by a stranger. I hope this person has not yet discovered that people film this and put it up on YouTube.

### Legality

Laws reflect the moral norms of society. Moral: *Thou shalt not murder*, hence laws against killing. Moral: *Thou shalt not steal*, hence laws against robbery. However the authors of the Bible didn't envision airports and lost luggage, else: *Thou shalt not open others peoples luggage* might have been up there in the ten commandments.

Of course this is perfectly legal thing to be doing. The airport waits for the passengers to turn up, if within a year, no one comes, they sell the bags to the highest bidder, who then becomes the new owner.

Now why does the airport not simply scan the baggage tag and inform the passengers? All these bags have baggage tags and a single scan would identify the owner. The airport I know of simply has not got the stuff to do that. I also don't know which university degree one requires to operate a scanning device however, from my experience, scanning barcodes with a scanner isn't rocket science. It can actually be a very meditative task!

In the end, I would argue that morally this is anti-social activity. Also there is a moral precedent: *Do onto others as you would have them do to you*. Of course, if you have no problem with having you dirty underwear go viral on YouTube, then this does not apply to you.

To anyone intending to do this, ask yourself how you would feel if it is your luggage? Sure you might be able to finance your next holiday from the advertising revenue, however I just hope you don't lose your luggage.
