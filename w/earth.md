## Earth

We are all astronauts on spaceship earth.

Earth might not be made by us but it is still the biggest spaceship we have. It would be interesting to calculate how far we have actually travelled through space on the planet Earth.

I guess this would be a combination how long have humans been around and how fast is our galaxy travelling. Earth is just rotating around the sun, so that's kind of going in circles. So any travelling *through* space we do via our galaxy. Although our galaxy is probably also rotating around something, that is, also going in circles. But let's ignore that!

Apparently our galaxy is travelling at [200 km per second](https://www.space.com/33527-how-fast-is-earth-moving.html), which is equivalent to 720,000 km/h.

Humans have probably been on the planet for about [50,000 years](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-long-have-humans-been-on-earth.html), give or take. There are about [8765.812536](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/time/hours-in-year.html) hours in a year (taking a tropical year).

So that all becomes the following:

```
          720,000 km/hour
x     8765.812536 hours/year
x          50,000 years
--------------------
  315569251296000 km
```

So 315,569,251,296,000 kilometers or about 316 trillion kilometers.

### BTW

The term *[Spaceship Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_Earth)* is older than I thought, turns out first used around 1879.

By coincident [Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) used the term in his book [Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_Manual_for_Spaceship_Earth). Coincident because he also coined the term [ephemeralization](/w/ephemeralization), which is a favourite of mine.
