## Time

1. Make room for the future.

   Sometimes we have too much in our heads and don't realise that we need to make room for the future.

2. Take the present and make a new past.

   Forget the past and take the now and make a new past.

3. It looks like today but smells of yesterday.

   Sometimes it's [groundhogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)) all the way down.

4. If the future isn't now, when is it?

   I'm sure I don't know.

5. [How long is now](http://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.xn-DSy6fjRGFiW3C3pV70QHaHa&pid=Api&f=1)

   Pity that it is no longer - the mural.
