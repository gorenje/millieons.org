## Choices

Is it humans fate to be confused and unsure in later life since he/she has experienced so much that she/he doesn't know what to do?

Is choice killing future?

Making choices is a daily, minutely, constant activity and with more experiences, the number of possible choices increase thus making choices harder to make.

Thus making, *making the right choice* a near impossibility.
