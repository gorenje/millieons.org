## Poor choices

No one makes poor choices, it's only looking back that we are forced to behold our choices ripen into bad decisions.

Everyone makes many choices, every moment of every day. These choices are never bad. We don't consciously make bad choices. We make decisions based on the best of our knowledge. However sometimes we simply didn't have neither the wisdom nor the knowledge to make the right decision.

But this assessment can only be made in hindsight. With the addition of more knowledge it can become obvious that a poor choice was, unfortunately taken.

Only poor choices ripen into bad decisions. But this wisdom only comes with hindsight.
