## Mapping Information Bubbles

Recently I created a mind map to make sense of all my writing and thoughts. I have many pages of electronic thoughts, ideas and happenings that I wanted to collect together into a single navigable overview. I have tried mind maps before but found them to be too restrictive for me. So it was not until I found a tool that was more flexible and not designed for mind maps that I decided to create a mind map using that tool.

I do not want to go into details about the tool, rather I would like to write about what I discovered while building up my mind map. It begins with the idea of  [information bubbles](https://matthewrenze.com/articles/what-are-information-bubbles/) which are related to [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) which can then lead to [echo chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)). These are all similar and related ideas, for me though the information bubble is simply the limit of our personal knowledge and information base, beyond it lies unknowing and blissful ignorance.

Everyone has an informational bubble be it reinforced by social media or search engines, being human means one lives in an information bubble. For me the question how do I discover the boundaries of that information bubble and how do I discover the lands outside that bubble? I going to concern myself with mapping information bubbles using mind maps and the fruitless efforts to escape information bubbles. Mind maps are not street maps, making them an imperfect tool for escaping information bubbles. But what if there was another solution, another way out?

*Technology is not to be blamed.*

Technology isn't to be blamed for our information bubbles, technology only reinforces what we, as humans naturally do. Being humans means living in an information bubble, else reality would overcome us.

Humans naturally have mental draws. Our minds can be pictured as a cupboard with many draws. Each draw represents a simplification we all make about our surroundings and reality. Each drawer has a label and we are continually putting in and taking out of these draws. The smallest bubbles we have are our mental concepts - "water", "colour", "tree", and so on - each represents a grouping of, for example, specific trees, or specific flowers. We would never question that the liquid flowing down a stream is not water. These informational bubbles help us to navigate the environment around us. 

We as a species understood the concept of water and began to realise that it comes from the sky and flows in the form of rivers. It freezes and melts and comes in many forms of ice crystals. We don't differentiate between the snow we find in the Himalayans compared to the snow in the Alps, each is a *specific* form of snow, both fall under the same *concept* of snow though.

*Can information bubbles be good?*

For many information bubbles provide a safe space where nothing bad can happen. These are the spaces where we surround ourselves with like-minded others who one knows won't confront one. These spaces are wonderful but fragile. They can easily be disturbed by external forces. They are a type of labile space. A labile state is a steady state that when disturbed, will not return to the original state. On the other hand, a stable state is one that will return to its original steady state once disturbed.

Imagine a bowl with a marble in the bottom. Pushing the marble will move it around the bowl but eventually the marble will come to rest at its original position. That is a stable state. A labile state is turning the bowl around and place the marble at the peak of the bowl. The marble is a balanced steady state but when disturbed, the marble will roll down never to return to its original steady state at the peak of the bowl.

For us in our bubbles all is well until something disturbs this bubble. Once it has been disturbed, it will never be the same as before because of all the effort required to create it in the first place. 

*Information bubbles are entropy free zones.*

Entropy is a measure of randomness, order goes against entropy. The higher the entropy of a system, the more chaotic it is. Imagine pouring hot water into a tub of cold water, the entropy increases as the hot water spreads throughout the tub giving the water an even temperature throughout but the molecules are more chaotic and dispersed. Systems left on their own, without any external interference, tend to the state with the highest entropy.

Informational bubbles pretend that entropy does not happen, that disorder and chaos are outside of the bubble and will not affect the bubble. The bubble is stable and ordered and will remain that way - ideally - forever. As he Earth within the Universe - ordered, stable and protected by a thin layer of gases called the atmosphere. Except for the occasional meteor or astroid, we are all safe and contented here on spaceship Earth. The universe is unfortunately not stable and has ever increasing entropy. It is everything else than we pretend it to be. 

In the long term an information bubble will burst. That is a natural part of living, the external forces will one day break in. As children our parents protected us from things we were not meant to know. We have sex education in school and finally we became parents ourselves. This is the cycle of human existence - without children, without information bubbles we won't be here. Information bubbles have their place, without them we would not be able to cope with the complexities of existence.

The information bubbles that I would like to explore are those that are not as old and set as the concepts we have builtin from our natural surroundings. I would like to address the information bubbles that technology unknowingly creates around us. Protecting us from the controversial opinions that might bring us to develop new wisdoms and question the old wisdoms, expanding our intellectual horizons. 

*How to escape the bubble?*

Recognition is the first step to cure. Realising and accepting that there is knowledge beyond our boundaries is a step. How to we break through those boundaries? Our information bubbles do not have signs: *don't go there*. Or doors marked with *do not enter here*, or *in case of unknowingness, break glass*. In short, the boundaries of our information bubbles are transparent, not signposted and we can only make a guess where we extend those boundaries.

Another approach would be to create a map of the information bubble, a cartographic representation of the information bubble. We implicitly do this everyday by giving our opinions and talking to others but we do not do this in a structured way. In just a way that we can look at our mind and its information bubble and reflect on what is missing. 

I will not go into details on how to map a information bubble, instead I will discuss mind maps as the tool that I chose. Wikipedia describes [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) as:

> A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information into a hierarchy, showing relationships among pieces of the whole. It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Expanding the principle and imagine creating a mind map with all your thoughts, fears, ideas, worries, intentions and beliefs as circles and connecting these with lines that have meaning for you. Imagine that the lines have no meaning other than there is a connection, be it a dependency or an influence or a feeling. Imagine being able to connect anything with anything else. Classic mind maps have an enforced direction on connections, going out from a central concept. Other forms of mind maps exist, but for me, none have the flexibility that I am looking for to represent my mind.

When I speak of mind maps, I imagine an ad-hoc chaotic representation of my mind. Meaning that anything is allowed and everything can be connected. Connections have no meaning other than that they lead me to something else. For me it is similar to doodling on a piece of paper, random doodles are created, expanded and replaced. Order and organisation comes later, meaning comes later, and interpretation is the final step.

*Creating my own mind map.*

I found the tool and partly adapted it to my needs but I can now create the mind map I imagined. Having gone through the exercise, I can only say that it is a lot of work and discipline. It remains an ongoing project, it will most certainly never be completed. I have to admit I had a lot of source material. I meticulously write down all my thoughts and ideas, I keep a diary of these ideas and the events that lead up to them. Thankfully all of it was in electronic form. And it was this source material that actually led me to do this. I was faced with a one-dimensional world of writings, I no longer knew what was there. I needed a new representation, a two-dimensional representation. 

The mind map I created was a bi-directional, multi-connecting chaotic collection of nodes, each with their own meaning but meaningless connections between them. My mind map is a two-dimensional representations of my mind and writings and reality is the three dimensional manifestation of my mind.

*Can a mind map decompose an information bubble?*

I came realise that the mind map I had created was a representation of my information bubble, of my biases and my blind spots. I had created an honest and truthful map of my ideas, thoughts and beliefs, a picture of my information bubble was created. The mind map provided a cartographic representation of my information bubble. In a sense, the mind map had decomposed my information bubble into its elementary parts in the form of simple concepts.

Unfortunately though, a mind map is not a street map or a map of a city. A street map shows one all the other streets in a city, a personal mind map has no unvisited areas. In that sense the mind map does not make it easy for one to escape the information bubble, it only decomposes it into fundamental concepts.

A mind map shows only a single information bubble, one does not see what is missing. And this is the hole that that we pull need to pull ourselves out of, by our own hair! Our information bubble tells us nothing about what else is out there, our mind maps are a mirrors into our minds, not a plan of escape.

Frustratingly having spent a lifetime creating this amazingly complex information bubble in my head, having mapped it into a complex mind map, how can I now find those unmapped streets, avenues or parks? How to move outside of the known areas of my mind. Enter the open street map.

*Take the map, share and explore the unknown lands.*

Taking the analogy with street maps a step further. We have global street maps, [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/51.330/10.453) is a societally built and maintained map of the world. We have a societally built and maintained one-dimensional source of knowledge - Wikipedia. Would it not be a benefit to all to have an open collection of mind maps so we can all escape our own bubbles?

I imagine a site where you begin from your mind map and move along new connections to other mind maps from fellow astronauts on spaceship Earth. Because you begin in places you know - your own mind map - moving around from that knowledge space is a gentle confrontation with other thoughts and views.

As I move along my mind map paths, I will always encounter other paths that other people have taken, it is up to me to take those new paths, unexplored for me regions represent those places other have already been. Combining mind maps from many will be represent a global atlas of knowledge, such as Wikipedia does in one-dimension, [openmindmap.org](https://openmindmap.org) would build those street maps of human knowledge.

The irony of any such application would be that the underlying algorithms would implicitly create, if even somewhat larger, further information bubbles. This irony is not lost on the author!
