## Are we in a permanent state of cognitive dissonance?

I would say: Yes and No.

[Cognitive Dissonance -](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)

> In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance occurs when a person holds contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, and is typically experienced as psychological stress when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent. The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.

In an age of fake news, fake science, fake everything of the western media, we are constantly faced with the doubts whether something is fake or someone is lying or are we facing certain doom or is it all in our collective heads.
