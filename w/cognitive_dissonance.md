## Are we in a permanent state of cognitive dissonance?

I would say: Yes and No.

[Cognitive Dissonance -](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)

> In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance occurs when a person holds contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, and is typically experienced as psychological stress when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent. The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.

In an age of fake news, [fake science](/a/science), fake everything in the western media, we are constantly faced with the doubts whether something is fake or someone is lying or are we facing certain doom. Or is it all just in our collective heads?

Since the default reaction to the uncertainty is fear, it now becomes possible to consider ideas and notions that aren't [awesome](/c/awesome) or [really exciting](/c/exciting) or [amazing](/c/amazing) since their opposites are now a big part of what is happening around us. Surprising and unexpected events are overtaking the suburbs and we are all living in [strange times](/a/will-we-be-shot).

So we might be seeing the entry of the [defeatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeatism) actors onto the stage of this play of ours. But the good news is that people who lived through the black plague must have thought the same.

Always remember, every single one of us alive today is descended from people that survived. Our ancestors survived wars, famine, slavery, religion pogrom and many more unimaginable horrors. We're tough enough to get through this.

### Danger of Fatalism

Having defeatist or negative outlook in uncertain times is one thing, more scary are the consequences of [fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism). The assumption being that we can't change anything because we are living in a preordained society where nothing changes. And nothing changes is the impression we get when we read the news â€” scandal after scandal, but no one is brought to justice. Politics seems to be constant stream of disappointments.

What I think is happening is that political class is painting themselves into a corner of irrelevance. Which simply means that society has to work around the political class. In a world where everyone is selling themselves, and by extension, everyone is a businessperson, politics has minimal influence. Or rather politics also becomes a business.

So instead of the political class pretending to us that we have power because we get to vote every few years, we should turn that around and begin to pretend to the political class that we care and belief they have power. We need to massage their egos a bit.

For this to happen, we have to realise that we make change happen and no, the world is not running by some preordained master plan. It's just hard to hear the whispers in a world where everyone is shouting.

### Adam Curtis

If you want hear more about this, then [Adam Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis) is a good start. In particular his last documentary [*Can't Get You Out of My Head*](https://thoughtmaybe.com/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head/).
