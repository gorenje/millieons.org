## Are we in a permanent state of cognitive dissonance?

I would say: Yes and No.

[Cognitive Dissonance -](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)

> In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance occurs when a person holds contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, and is typically experienced as psychological stress when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent. The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.

In an age of fake news, fake science, fake everything in the western media, we are constantly faced with the doubts whether something is fake or someone is lying or are we facing certain doom. Or is it all just in our collective heads?

Since the default reaction to the uncertainty is fear, it now becomes possible to consider ideas and notions that aren't [awesome](/c/awesome) or [really exciting](/c/exciting) or [amazing](/c/amazing) since their opposites are now a big part of what is happening around us. Surprising and unexpected events are overtaking the suburbs and we are all living in [strange times](/a/will-we-be-shot).

So we might be seeing the entry of the [fatalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism) actors onto the stage of this play of ours. But the good news is that people who lived through the black plague must have thought the same.

And always remember, everyone of us alive today is descended of people that survived. Our ancestors survived wars, famine and a lot worse. We're tough enough to get through this.
