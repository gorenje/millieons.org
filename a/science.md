## Is science the last bastion of truth in the western world?

*To tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me science.*

Has become somewhat the new slogan of the internet crowd. Everywhere you look you find people quoting this study or that piece of innovate research. Everyone is backing up their arguments with their favourite scientific research that vaguely says that or that other scientist that said something slightly differently. People calling out for "numbers" to backup arguments. 

*Numbers never lie.*

Is another slogan bandied about. Unfortunately this is true: numbers never lie however, something else that is true is that numbers are manipulated. Who does the manipulating? Well not the numbers themselves.

What will happen when this bastion starts to crumble? When we realise that even science is manipulated by corporations. When we discover that science feeds the hungry desires of hidden corporations all over the world to make them rich and us poor. 

And in fact science has been influenced by industry. ~~Since the 60s or even 50s?~~ [Since the 40s](https://www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement):

> To this end, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company created a Medical Relations Division and advertised it in medical journals. Reynolds began paying for research and then citing it in its ads like Philip Morris. In 1946, Reynolds launched an ad campaign with the slogan, “More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.” They’d solicited this “finding” by giving doctors a free carton of Camel cigarettes, and then asking what brand they smoked.

This is also described in a documentary on [Arte.tv](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/091148-000-A/forschung-fake-und-faule-tricks/). Big business is simply doing "research" that backs up there claims. In the end discrediting the science community and leaving everyone else with a big [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt) headache.

It gets worse, there is a concept of ["undone science"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0162243909345836) - science that doesn't get done because it's not getting funded. Mainly because it's science that doesn't look likely to make money in the future. So basic research isn't been done because either there is no way of making money with it or no way to patent the research results.
