## Poisoned secrets

Poisoned secret is a secret that destroys your life even though it's not your secret. It's a secret that you've been told and told to keep it a secret. But this secret has a profound effect on your own psychological wellbeing. This makes the secret poison.

You live under the ramifications of something that you never did or experienced. You had no influence of those events/actions and now are stuck under the spell of this secret. The secret is so bad that the person who told you had to get it of their chests and unfortunately chose you.

Since you can't talk to anyone about the secret but you know that you have to escape the secret. You have one of two options: talk to the person who told you the secret or break their trust and tell someone else.

Of course the third option is to do nothing and let the secret eat you up from the inside.

Decide well.
