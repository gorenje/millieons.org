## Is there a consumer class?

*Is the middle class a poor upper class or a rich lower class?*

We still talk of the upper class, the middle class and lower class. Where the middle class is either a rich form of the lower class or a poor form of the upper class.

But what about a consumer class? Is there in fact a consumer class that is spread across all the existing class structure and closing the feedback loop that drives capitalism? Some spend lots for little and some spend little for lots and that very often, both spend the same. 

Universal Basic Income would be one such approach. [Massive Attacks video](https://youtu.be/a-1YI-neupU) is a good starting for thinking about these things.

*Prevent money from deadend'ing in the accounts of the rich!*

Also what does it matter if we print money, it always ends up at dead-end points, i.e., the rich. and they can't possibly spend all that money. so that means their money doesn't get spent and won't go around in the capitalist circle.

*Is consumption the final purpose of humans?*

With everything automated and humans basically be replaceable, is consumption they only purpose left to humans? With more and more fields being replaced by people pushing buttons and there is no longer a requirement for any sort of lateral thinking and intelligences (or better said, very limited fields), does the majority of humans centre around consuming and being told by others what to consume?

In times of individualism there is no sense of sharing. So everyone buys the same products and doesn't share their usage because they mistrust their neighbour. This leads to everyone buying the same under utilised products.
