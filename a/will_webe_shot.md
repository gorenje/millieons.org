## Will we be shot?

Very uncomfortable thought however we are living in strange times. "Never again in Europe." is the generally thinking on the matter however, who would have thought that something like Covid would be so destructive for Europe?

Europe was already moving right before Covid but covid will only accelerate this. And "Never again in Europe" will become "It's only a matter of time in Europe". This is uncomfortable for all those that have lived in peace for so long.

This question can also be turned around and formulated to become "Will I be shot"?

No one would like an answer to either question. No one wants to even consider this questions. But perhaps there is a time coming when we will not be able to avoid these questions.

Let's hope not.
