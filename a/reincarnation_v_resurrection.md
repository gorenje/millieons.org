## Reincarnation versus Resurrection

Which of the two concepts is better for keeping society in check? I don't which to enter the world of belief systems, I would purely compare the two concepts for the purpose of maintaining a stable societal construct.

Both concepts have very detailed Wikipedia pages: [Reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation) and [Resurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection) for reference purposes. 

*WARNING*: Oversimplification ahead! For the sake of argument, I'm just going outline both concepts â€” there is a lot more to both of these.

Both concepts deal with what happens with the soul after death.

Reincarnation makes the claim that the soul is reborn back onto the earth in either human or animal form. Whether someone moves up the ladder (i.e., reborn in human form) or down the ladder (i.e., animal form) depends on their [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) - good Karma human form, bad karma animal form.

For a soul, this can happen depending on believe system, multiple or even infinite number of times. Of course, memories of previous existences aren't readily available for the reborn.

Resurrection makes the claim that the soul is taken to either heaven or hell, depending on whether someone was "good" or "bad". Hereby both good and bad are defined by the respective belief system. After the soul is taken up to heaven or down to hell, it remains there for all eternity. Resurrection happens exactly once for each soul, there is no recycling of souls.

Herein lie the differences I would like to discuss: 

1. Resurrection claims that the soul is single-use while reincarnation is multi-use.
2. Resurrection passes soul judgement in abstract locations (i.e., heaven and hell) while reincarnation passes soul judgement right here on the planet (i.e., a very real location).

### Location is everything

As is the case with real estate, I would argue the location for soul judgement is everything. If I'm to be judged in an abstract location that I've never known, then I will forever fear the bad location (i.e., hell) because my imagine can conjure up a horrible world of fire and brimstones. Conversely heaven is a tip-top paradise made just for me! (Tangent thought: how is it possible to create a place that is a paradise for everyone? Or is there really a personal heaven for each soul?)

But I could also take the point of view, since both places are abstract, that I say to myself: *bugger that, hell won't be that bad so I'll do whatever it takes to survive*. Now if everyone would take this approach, then we would have a form of anarchy as societal construct.

On the other hand, reincarnation prescribes the soul judgement to occur right here on the planet. I have a definite association with the location of the judgement of my soul: I've lived here my entire life.

So if I take the same approach and say, fine I don't mind going down the ladder, so I do whatever it takes to survive. That could have the consequence that I come back as an animal to be put through the slaughterhouse. Battery hens also come to mind.

Summing up: having a connection to the location of soul judgement has an affect on my value judgement of *how bad can the afterlife be?*.

### Multi-Use versus Single-Use Souls

If I believed that there is no recycling of my soul, would I think in the long term? Would I be more or less interested in the long term effects of my actions?

In combination of only having one soul and having the soul being transported off this place, would my actions be optimised for ensuring that my soul goes to heaven or that this place becomes a better place?

From a purely logical perspective, having a multi-use soul reborn onto this planet would seem to be far more motivational for improving this place.

### Impact on a societal construct

So I would argue that reincarnation would be a better instrument for maintaining social order within a societal construct. In fact, perhaps it would be a better approach than an [panopticon](/a/panopticon) as proposed by [Nick Bostrom](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12718).

This is of course just a thought experiment, humans are incredible complex and hard to predict. So do take this with a pinch of salt.

But why do I mention all this in the first place? Because the early Christian church actually taught reincarnation.

### Early Christian Teachings

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation#Christianity) mentions this and there a few indirect references in the bible:

- [Matthew 17:10-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+17%3A10-13&version=ESV) describes Elijah being reincarnated as John the Baptist. 
- [Matthew 16:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A13-16&version=ESV) in which Jesus asks his followers from whom he might have been reincarnated.

However reincarnation was removed by [Justinian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I) as part of the [5th ecumenical council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Council_of_Constantinople), point 1 on this [list](https://comparativereligion.com/anathemas.html). Basically this meant the removal of the teachings of [Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen) whose teachings included reincarnation and an ascetic lifestyle. 

According to legend, it was Justinian's wife [Theodora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodora_(wife_of_Justinian_I)) who wanted the removal of reincarnation. She feared because of her many misdeeds and acts of evil, to be punished in an afterlife. So for her it was a simply a matter of making reincarnation an act of heresy and with that, she won't be reborn. Irony is that she died with only 49. 

How could this have had an impact? Imagine the soldiers going off on their crusades to the Holy Land. Imagine what if they believed that they would be reincarnated. Perhaps they would have not been so violent ...
