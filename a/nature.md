## Nature

Nature is a Fiction.

Nature is a fiction created by us to explain trees. This is an interesting thought that even 'nature' doesn't really exist, rather a term that we invented to explain what a tree does or why there are animals, etc. So claiming that nature is dying is, in a certain sense, escapism since we're distancing ourselves from our creation.

We are all a part of this planet and using the term nature is a split along the lines of them and us.
