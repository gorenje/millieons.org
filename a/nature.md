## Nature

Nature is a Fiction.

Nature is a fiction created by homo sapiens to explain trees. This is an provocative thought that even 'nature' doesn't really exist, rather a term that we invented to explain what a tree does or why there are animals, etc.

Claiming that nature is dying is escapism since we're distancing ourselves from our own basis for existence.

We are all a part of this planet and using the term nature is to split along the lines of them and us.

Perhaps we should begin to use, not only amongst ourselves but with everything around us, more inclusive formalisations.

### Nature the Survivor

Besides that, "nature" won't die, it will continute to evolve as it has done for eons. Even if in our infinite arrogance, we think we can control nature, we always seem to fail. Perhaps we should accept that nature is controlling us.
