## How tell children adult secrets

Parents sometimes find it hard to explain to teenage children why certain things happen. Sometimes things happen that simple can't be explained because these things involve adult secrets. Adult secrets, as the name suggests, aren't suitable for the ears of children.

However these children are indirectly affected by these adult secrets. Be it through unhappiness, be it through stress, be it through blaming themselves. Unhappiness of the parents, stress in the relationship or children thinking they are the cause for the imbalance.

### Clickbait

In fact this text isn't about how to tell an adult secret to a child! Well not directly in case the reader was thinking that. That is in fact the problem and there is — at least I don't know of one — no direct solution to the problem.

Instead I propose an indirect solution. A solution that does require the telling of the secret but to another adult. This adult then makes a valued judgement.

### Step 1 Allow the child to pick an adult they trust

The child should pick/select an adult that they trust. Ideally this is an adult also trusted by the parents. Important is that the child trusts the adult, the trust to the child is more important than the trust to the parents.

### Step 2 Tell that adult the secret and the context

Once the adult has been chosen, talk to them about what happen and explain to them the adult secret. If this isn't possible because it is suddenly to painful, then best to exit the exercise immediately.

Allow the chosen adult to evaluate the situation. Perhaps something else can be done. Perhaps there is another solution and there is no need to explain anything to the child.

### Step 3 Get that adult to talk to the child

Once the chosen adult has been briefed, it's time to talk to the child. Of course the child should not be told the secret. Also whether the parents are present or not is an open question.

### Conclusion

Indirectly then we have told the child the secret or at least that it knows that things, they way they happened, are ok.

The intention here is to have a neutral party confirm the parents in their actions.  Because the child trusts the neutral party, they also believe them. This makes the neutral party a confirmation party and also someone the child can confide in.

It should also be considered that perhaps one can wait until the child is old enough to explain the situation. It all depends the impact of the situation at hand and the cost of explaining now or waiting.

Of course, this can be particularly difficult if dealing with a [poisoned secret](/a/poisoned-secrets). Since the delicacy of the secret might well mean that it's not something that even other adults should be told.
