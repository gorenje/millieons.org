## Argue

From Arguing 

- to Domination 
- to Discussion 
- to Debate 
- to Constructive

There are different forms of communication between people. Arguing is an aggressive form, constructive is positive.

- constructivism: Here I'm thinking for a Tetris like where both players are building up a pile of points into a coherent block - both are working together

- debating is like a tag-of-war where both are trying to convince the other their point of view, with neither accepting the view of the other

- lecturing/domination is the one dominating the other not even allowing the other to speak let alone get their point of view across
