## Argue

From Arguing

- to Domination
- to Discussion
- to Debate
- to Constructivism

There are different forms of communication amongst peoples. Arguing is an aggressive form, constructivism is positive.

- constructivism: Here I'm thinking of a Tetris game where both players are building up piles of discussion fragments into coherent ideas - both are working together and topics change as ideas are completed.

- debating is a tag-of-war where both are trying to convince the other their point of view, with neither accepting the view of the other. there is no protocol for agreement as it is a tug-of-war. the winner is the one who's less frustrated at the end.

- lecturing/domination is the one dominating the other not even allowing the other to speak let alone get their point of view and ideas across. there is no escape here except to hope the dominator runs out of breath before the end of the world.
