## Agile Waterfalls

Back in the day of waterfall, everyone complained about how rigid the waterfall process really is and how it's hard to be flexible when change happened in the requirements.

So then everyone jumped on the *extreme programming* bandwagon because it made those promises of changes that everyone loves to hear.

And change it was.

The river was dried, the waterfall disappeared to be replaced by a flexible mound of ideas and concepts.

These concepts, since extreme programming was simple a collection of ideas that each team could pick and choose from, agile processes shoot up like magic mushrooms on moist forest floor.

Each one simply being a structurisation of the different XP concepts into clearly defined process. And there we have it: a process! Teams can't live or succeed (sic!) without having a process. Which is exactly the complaint levelled at waterfall: it's a process that is too rigid.

So of course all the scrum masters on the planet will say *but we called it agile so, by definition, it can't be rigid*. So there you have it, Agile can't be rigid since its called agile.

All those planning meetings, retrospective meetings and stand ups and dailys and post-it notes and kanban boards ([ouija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija) board anyone?) and those swim lanes and who knows what else aren't rigid they are agile. They are especially agile when they come together is a fixed process.

But that's not what I was going to complain about. *sigh*

What I was going to point out was that with waterfall, not only was it rigid but each role was clearly defined and everyone knew for what they were responsible. There were people that wrote requirements, there where people that wrote specifications and there were those that coded. And finally there were people that showed the result to the customer.

Agile methods seem to allow everyone to have a word and opinion on everything - including the process itself. And hence no one actually gets anything done - other than meta activities such organising further meetings.

It seems to me that agile is like a bunch of chefs in the kitchen, each throwing they stuff into the soup but the soup simply never boils.

But here we are.

## So what is the fix?

I for me would say that the fix is going back to the early days of XP and giving just a little more freedom for teams to decide what they want to use.

Since each person is different, each person has their own level of personal freedom. And good team will find that amongst themselves.

But that won't help most teams. Since it seems to me that most people simple need guidance in everything they do. So allowing them freedom to do whatever they think is good will end up with them asking you what they should do.


## But why complain about Agile?

Why? Well because I simply can't believe the financially successful people like Elon Musk succeeded because they applied agile processes to what they were doing. I really doubt that Elon Musk does a weekly retrospective to discuss his tweets over the week .... (and if so, then the retrospective doesn't really work)
