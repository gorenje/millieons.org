## Is "to share" losing meaning?

To share something used to mean that you shared with friend something that you owned as a favour. You did this without any expectations or payments. 

Now days, with the "sharing" economy, sharing has become something that is synonym with renting, not sharing. 

Car sharing, AirBnB, Uber, ride sharing etc - these are all rental services that have nothing to do with sharing. They claim they are sharing but, since you're paying, it's actually renting. 

Sharing is something very different to renting.
