## Texts

Longer texts, shorter words.

### Societal Constructs

- [Life, Death and AIs](/a/life-death-and-ais) considers the very real situation of a self driving car deciding over life and death. Quite on point: Spain has just this month (Mar 2021) introduced a [self driving bus](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/europe-first-autonomous-electric-buses-spain/)...

- Need an argument for a world wide [panopticon](https://aeon.co/essays/none-of-our-technologies-has-managed-to-destroy-humanity-yet)? [Nick Bostrom](https://nickbostrom.com/) is very convincing, however its not the [only solution](/a/panopticon).

- Is fake science the new [science](/a/science)? With the raise of fake news, one could imagine this also happening to science. The unfortunate truth is that fake science outdates fake news by about 50 years. Of course, no one believes that since fake news has always been around with us!

- And related to that is [fake nature](/a/nature) — our attempt to become the master of what is around us. We have lost touch with the beauty all around us and by extension, in us.

- Remember sharing? Rent it instead. Is sharing [losing its meaning](/a/share)?

- Why is that Christians have resurrection and Buddhist have reincarnation? Which is [better for society](/a/reincarnation-v-resurrection)? Which is better for the long term?

- What is the middle class? Is the middle class the poor rich-class or the rich lower-class? Are we all members of the [consumer class](/a/consumer)?

- [Small steps](/t/smallchanges) to change a large world. Revolutions come and go, their changes tend to be limited. *Big changes come from small steps*.

- Why are we all so [closed](/w/closed)?

### Unfortunate Happenstances

- Some secrets are [poisonous secrets](/a/poisoned-secrets) — the kind that end up eating you up from the inside.

- [Adult secrets](/a/how-tell-children-adult-secrets) are the type of secrets that should not be told to children. However sometimes the conflict of keeping secrets is worse. What to do?

- Sometimes we do have [worries](/a/will-we-be-shot), its part of the human condition. The trick is to know worries are a kind of paranoia. Enjoy life instead, it takes a lot less energy than worrying.

- [Cognitive dissonance](/w/cognitive-dissonance) can sometimes get in the way of a wonderful [relationship](/a/cognitive-dissonance-in-relationships).

- War is an unfortunate situation forced by the [few onto the many](/n/europe).

### Human Condition

- It took a while for me to learn how to [explain](/w/explain). Explaining things to other people is about talking in their language.

- No one makes [poor choices](/w/poor-choices), hindsight transforms choices and decisions. Does making choices become [harder with age](/w/choices), increasing poor choices?

- Sometimes it helps to let the [subconscious](/w/subconscious) take over. Remember, there is far more going in there than in your conscious - power to the brain!

- Why do we sometimes [drink](/w/alcohol)? Perhaps we drink to [trust](/w/trust) more.

- Empathetic and empathic are the same word just written differently, showing [empathy](/w/empathy) on the other hand is hard.

- To be, or not to be an [egoist](/v/altruist-v-egoist)? Is the world of an [altruist](/v/altruist-v-egoist) better?

### Tangents

What is [matter](/w/matter)? We're all on [Spaceship Earth](/w/earth). Losing the sense of [time](/w/time).

*The invention of the hammer has lead to a frenzied search for nails.*

And remember, always be [polite](/a/argue) when having discussions with others.
