## Texts

Longer texts, shorter words.

### Societal Constructs

- [Life, Death and AIs](/a/life-death-and-ais) considers the very real situation of a self driving car deciding over life and death. Quite on point: Spain has just this month (Mar 2021) introduced a [self driving bus](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/europe-first-autonomous-electric-buses-spain/)...

- Need an argument for a world wide [panopticon](https://aeon.co/essays/none-of-our-technologies-has-managed-to-destroy-humanity-yet)? [Nick Bostrom](https://nickbostrom.com/) is very convincing, however its not the [only solution](/a/panopticon).

- Is fake science the new [science](/a/science)? With the raise of fake news, one could imagine this also happening to science. The unfortunate truth is that fake science outdates fake news by about 50 years. Of course, no one believes that since fake news has always been around with us!

- And related to that is [fake nature](/a/nature) — our attempt to become the master of what is around us. We have lost touch with the beauty all around us and by extension, in us.

- Remember sharing? Rent it instead. Is sharing [losing its meaning](/a/share)?

- Why is that Christians have resurrection and Buddhist have reincarnation? Which is [better for society](/a/reincarnation-v-resurrection)? Which is better for the long term?

- What is the middle class? Is the middle class the poor rich-class or the rich lower-class? Are we all members of the consumer class?

### Unfortunate Happenstances

- [Adult secrets](/a/how-tell-children-adult-secrets) are the type of secrets that should not be told to children. However sometimes the conflict of keeping secrets is worse. What to do?

- Sometimes we do have [worries](/a/will-we-be-shot), its part of the human condition. The trick is to know worries are a kind of paranoia. Enjoy life instead, it takes a lot less energy than worrying.

- Some secrets are [poisonous secrets](/a/poisoned-secrets) — the kind that end up eating you up from the inside.

### Human Condition

- It took a while for me to learn how to [explain](/w/explain).

- No one makes [poor choices](/w/poor-choices), hindsight makes them poor.

- Sometimes it helps to let the [subconscious](/w/subconscious) take over.

### Humor & Tangents

What is [matter](/w/matter)? Is the Earth a [spaceship](/w/earth)? Some of us have lost the sense of [time](/w/time). 

*The invention of the hammer has lead to a frenzied search for nails.*

And remember, always be [polite](/a/argue) when having discussions with others.
