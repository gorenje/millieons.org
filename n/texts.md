Longer texts, shorter words.

### Societal Constructs

[Life, Death and AIs](/a/life-death-and-ais) is all about considering the very real situation of a self driving car deciding over life and death. And Spain has just this month (Mar 2021) introduced a [self driving bus](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/europe-first-autonomous-electric-buses-spain/)...

Then there is the argument *for* a world wide [panopticon](/a/panopticon) by [Nick Bostrom](https://nickbostrom.com/). It is very convincing, just it isn't the only solution.

Is fake science the new [science](/a/science)? With the raise of fake news, one could imagine this also happening to science. The unfortunate truth is that fake science outdates fake news by about 50 years. Of course, no one believes that since fake news has always been around with us!

And related to that is [fake nature](/a/nature) — our attempt to become the master of what is around us. Perhaps humans are simply [control freaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_freak).

Remember [sharing](/a/share)? Rent it instead.

Why is that Christians have resurrection and Buddhist have reincarnation? Which is [better](/a/reincarnation-v-resurrection) for society?

### Unfortunate Happenstances

[Adult secrets](/a/how-tell-children-adult-secrets) are the type of secrets that should not be told to children. However sometimes the conflict of keeping secrets is worse. What to do?

Sometimes we do have [worries](/a/will-we-be-shot), its part of the human condition. The trick is to know worries are a kind of paranoia. Enjoy life instead, it takes a lot less energy than worrying.

Some secrets are [poisonous secrets](/a/poisoned-secrets) — the kind that end up eating you up from the inside.

Discussions with others can be so easy, if they have the correct [form](/a/argue).
