> The world is so loud  
  Everyone is screaming and shouting  
  And everyone is getting louder  
  Since the world is so loud  
  Screaming and shouting and selling you something  
  Everyone is a salesman, screaming and shouting  
  Selling you their wares, selling you themselves  
  The world is so loud you can't hear the whispers.
