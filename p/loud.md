> The world is so loud,  
  Everyone is screaming and shouting.  
  Everyone is getting louder,  
  The world is so loud.  
  Screaming and shouting and selling you something,  
  Telling you something.  
  Everyone selling you their wares,  
  Selling you themselves.  
  The world is so loud.  
  You can't hear the whispers.
